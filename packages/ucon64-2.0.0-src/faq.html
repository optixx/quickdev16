<a name="1"><b>Q1</b>: Why uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64 is designed for people who want to play all the games on the
   original hardware. Here you got a powerful tool to backup, restore games and
   for many other operations. It is just a keep-old-hardware-alive tool :-)<br>
   uCON64 is also useful for people without backup units as it can be used to
   manage ROM collections (it can be used to identify, rename, patch or convert
   files) and it <i>can</i> operate as an intelligent frontend for every
   available emulator.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="2"><b>Q2</b>: How do I get started using uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: On the uCON64 homepage you can find a link to a
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12381" target="_blank">
   download section</a>. There are two types of packages, binary and source.
   You can tell a package is a binary package if it has "bin" (without the
   quotes) in its name. The source code packages have "src" in their name.
   Unless you are a software developer you probably do not need to download any
   of the source packages.<br>
   Choose a binary package for your system. GNU/Linux users should choose a
   package with "linux" in its name, BeOS users a package with "beos" in its
   name and DOS users a package with "dos" in its name. Windows users can
   choose any or all of the packages with "win32" or "dos" in their name.
   Normally, they should choose a package with "win32" in its name. The DOS
   version also runs under Windows, but has some limitations. For example, the
   DOS version cannot handle long command lines. The Cygwin version does not
   have any serious limitations compared to the "normal" Win32 versions, but
   behaves a bit more Unix-like than Windows users might want. Users accustomed
   to Unix might prefer the Cygwin version. The Cygwin version needs some
   additional files, though. See <a href="#27">question 27</a>.<br>
   For installation instructions (for all versions) see
   <a href="#4">question 4</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="3"><b>Q3</b>: How do I compile/build uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Unless you are a software developer you probably do not need to
   compile it. Just download one of the pre-built binary distributions and
   proceed to <a href="#4">question 4</a>.<br>
   To compile uCON64 you need a compiler :-) You can use either GCC (GNU
   Compiler Collection) or the Visual C++ compiler. GCC can be freely
   downloaded from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html" target="_blank">
   http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</a>. Visual C++ can be bought for about 60
   euro (at 15 May 2003) in most computer shops.<br>
   uCON64 can be compiled for Unix (GNU/Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD), DOS,
   BeOS, Windows (95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP), AmigaOS (PPC/68K) and Mac OS X.<br>
   A DOS port of GCC (and other GNU development tools) named DJGPP is
   available from <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/" target="_blank">
   http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a>. A Win32 port of GCC (and many other GNU
   tools and libraries) named Cygwin is available from
   <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank">http://www.cygwin.com</a>.
   Another Win32 port of GCC (and other tools) named MinGW is available from
   <a href="http://www.mingw.org" target="_blank">http://www.mingw.org</a>.<br>
<br>
   <b>Configuring uCON64</b><br>
   Some features of uCON64 are configurable (only) at compile time. They are:<br>
   - whether uCON64 will produce debug output (default: no)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will have support for parallel port backup units (default:
   yes)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will use the ppdev interface for parallel port I/O (default:
   no)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will be able to use color in its display output (default:
   yes)<br>
   - whether add-on libraries will be dynamically loaded or linked (default:
   loaded)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will be able to use the discmage library (default: yes)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will have support for the CD64 (default: no)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will be able to read .gz and .zip files (default: not if a
   Makefile "template" is used, see below)<br>
   - whether uCON64 will use libusb/have support for USB backup units (default:
   no)<br>
<br>
   The presence or settings of these features is controlled by the header file
   config.h in combination with the makefiles. There are two ways to create a
   config.h and makefiles for uCON64:<br>
   (Before executing one of these steps read the section below concerning gzip
   &amp; zip support)<br>
   1.) Run the configure script "configure".<br>
   If you want default settings type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure<br>
   Otherwise you have to pass options to the configure script. To see which
   features can be controlled with the configure script, type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ./configure --help<br>
   2.) Copy a tried-and-tested config.h "template" to a file config.h and copy
   a Makefile "template" to a file Makefile.<br>
<br>
   The first way does not work under command.com or cmd.exe as these shells
   cannot (directly) execute Bash shell scripts. command.com is the default
   shell on Windows&nbsp;9x, cmd.exe is the default shell on Windows&nbsp;XP
   (NT/2000).<br>
   So, for DOS (DJGPP) copy config.h.orig to config.h and to
   libdiscmage/config.h, Makefile.orig to Makefile and
   libdiscmage/Makefile.orig to libdiscmage/Makefile. You can do the same for
   Cygwin, but in Cygwin you can get the same effect much easier by just
   running the configure script.<br>
   For Windows (Visual C++) copy config.h.vc6 to config.h and to
   libdiscmage/config.h. Do not copy any of the Makefile.vc6 files. You may do
   so, but do not complain if these instructions do not seem to be right after
   having done that.<br>
   To save us some work, for MinGW we only support configuring and building
   uCON64 from within MSYS (MinGW's POSIX build environment, a port of Bash).<br>
<br>
   <b>Support for files in gzip (.gz) or zip format (.zip)</b><br>
   For gzip &amp; zip support you need zlib. If you do not have zlib you can
   get it from <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/" target="_blank">
   http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a>. There are two ways to get gzip &amp; zip
   support for uCON64:<br>
   1.) When using the configure script.<br>
   By default gzip &amp; zip support will be enabled if configure can find zlib
   on your system. If you want to disable the feature, pass the option
   --without-zlib to the configure script.<br>
   2.) When using config.h and Makefile "templates".<br>
   By default gzip &amp; zip support is disabled. If you want to enable it you
   have to define the constant HAVE_ZLIB_H in config.h and libdiscmage/config.h
   (remove the "//" in front of the line that defines it) <i>and</i> ZLIB in
   Makefile and libdiscmage/Makefile (remove the "#" in front of the line that
   defines it).<br>
<br>
   If you want to change other things in config.h or the makefiles do so before
   proceeding to the next step.<br>
   You have finished the configuration steps now. The next instructions will
   tell you how to compile uCON64 with the settings you just made.<br>
<br>
   <b>Compiling uCON64</b><br>
   By default the library discmage will also be compiled. Discmage is used for
   several CD-related functions in uCON64, but is not required for non
   CD-related functions. For example, you will not need discmage for any of the
   SNES functions. Skip the next step if you do not want uCON64 to use
   discmage.<br>
<br>
   If you do not have a reason not to compile discmage and you are using DJGPP,
   Cygwin or MinGW you need the library libgcc.a. This library comes with those
   compilers but is usually not located in the standard library directory.
   However, the compiler needs to know where to find it. There are two possible
   ways to solve this problem:<br>
   1.) Copy the file libgcc.a to the standard library directory.<br>
   2.) Edit the file libdiscmage/Makefile so that the variable GCCA_DIR points
   to the directory containing libgcc.a.<br>
   The first option (copying the file) is preferred.<br>
<br>
   Now read the relevant section for the compiler you are using.<br>
<br>
   <b>GCC</b> (including DJGPP and Cygwin)<br>
   If you use Bash you may have to take one extra step before running make.
   Because of a strange design decision made by the authors of Bash, the
   environment variable OSTYPE is not exported on all platforms. Because of
   that, on several platforms (like FreeBSD and Mac OS X), you have to export it
   manually before running make. You can do that with the following command:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; export OSTYPE<br>
<br>
   If you have compiled uCON64 in the same directory before, first type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make clean<br>
<br>
   If you want to compile the source code including discmage, type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make<br>
   If you do not want to compile discmage the last command should look like
   this for DJGPP, Cygwin and MinGW:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make ucon64.exe<br>
   Otherwise it should look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make ucon64<br>
<br>
   If you use Mac OS X and get an error message that dlfcn.h cannot be found,
   please install the library
   <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat/" target="_blank">dlcompat</a>
   and try again.<br>
   On Unix systems other than GNU/Linux you might need to use "gmake" (GNU
   make) instead of "make". If the last make command has been successfully
   executed you can find the executable in the directory where you ran make.
   For DOS, Cygwin and MinGW you are now ready to proceed to
   <a href="#4">question 4</a>. For the other platforms one extra command is
   needed (or simply handy):<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; make install<br>
<br>
   Under Unix this command will ask for root's password, because uCON64 needs
   to be setuid root for parallel port access and because regular users usually
   do not have write access in the default installation directory,
   /usr/local/bin. If you configured uCON64 without support for parallel port
   backup units or if you configured it to use ppdev, uCON64 need not be setuid
   root. Just copy ucon64 to any directory you like.<br>
   Under Mac OS X it is usual to install programs in /usr/bin. You can override
   the default destination directory /usr/local/bin by setting the environment
   variable DESTDIR. So, in order to install uCON64 in the directory /usr/bin
   use a command like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; DESTDIR=/usr/bin make install<br>
   This works also on Unix.<br>
   "make install" also creates a configuration directory for uCON64 and copies
   discmage.so (Unix and BeOS) or discmage.dylib (Mac OS X) to it, so you may
   find it easier to use it.<br>
   Under BeOS this command will open a dialog window. Just follow the
   instructions.<br>
<br>
   <b>Visual C++</b><br>
   Start a command shell or "prompt" and go to the correct directory. If you
   have compiled uCON64 in the same directory before, first type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake /f Makefile.vc6 clean<br>
<br>
   If you want to compile the source code including discmage, type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake /f Makefile.vc6<br>
   If you do not want to compile discmage the last command should look like
   this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; nmake /f Makefile.vc6 ucon64.exe<br>
<br>
   Under GNU/Linux, DOS and Windows you could use UPX to compress the
   executable. UPX is available from
   <a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">
   http://upx.sourceforge.net</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="4"><b>Q4</b>: How do I install uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: It depends on what operating system you use. First read the
   information specific for your operating system. Then continue to the section
   <a href="#configbin">"How to configure the uCON64 executable"</a>.<br>
<br>
   <b>Unix (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris), BeOS &amp; Mac OS X</b><br>
   Start a command line shell like Bash. Then extract the binary package.
   To extract or unpack a package in .tar.gz format use a command line like
   this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; tar xvzf ucon64-1.9.8-1-linux-bin.tar.gz<br>
   Old versions of tar might not support the option z. In that case use a
   command line like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; gunzip -c ucon64-1.9.8-1-linux-bin.tar.gz | tar xvf -<br>
   To unzip a .zip file use a command line like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; unzip ucon64-1.9.8-1-beos-bin.zip<br>
   You should replace the file name with the name of the file you downloaded
   for your operating system. Unpacking or extracting a package does not have
   to be done on the command line. You could also use a program with a GUI
   (Graphical User Interface) like KDE's ark or a similar program.<br>
   After you have extracted the package install uCON64 by running the install
   script. On Unix, if you do not have root access, copy the uCON64 executable
   to a directory in your PATH. If you do have root access (i.e., know the root
   password), run the shell script install.sh. On BeOS just run the script
   install_beos.sh. For Unix do something like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cd ucon64-1.9.8-1-linux-bin<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ./install.sh<br>
   By default install.sh will try to copy ucon64 to /usr/local/bin. You can
   specify another directory by setting the environment variable DESTDIR.
   On Mac OS X programs are usually installed in the directory /usr/bin. Users
   of that OS might want to install uCON64 with a command like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; DESTDIR=/usr/bin ./install.sh<br>
<br>
   For copier I/O BeOS users will need Caz's driver inside ioport.zip or
   available at <a href="http://www.infernal.currantbun.com" target="_blank">
   http://www.infernal.currantbun.com</a>. You only need this driver if you
   will use uCON64 for communication with a backup unit. After you have decided
   whether to download ioport.zip continue on BeOS with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cd ucon64-1.9.8-1-beos-bin<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ./install_beos.sh<br>
   After the last command a dialog window will come up. Simply follow the
   instructions.<br>
<br>
   Now continue to the section
   <a href="#configbin">"How to configure the uCON64 executable"</a>.<br>
<br>
   <b>Windows (95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP) &amp; DOS</b><br>
   On Windows, unpack the package with a program like
   <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank">WinZip</a>,
   <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> or
   <a href="http://www.powerarchiver.com/" target="_blank">Power Archiver</a>.
   On plain DOS (DOS without Windows) use a program like
   <a href="http://www.pkware.com/" target="_blank">PKUNZIP</a>.<br>
   We recommend to extract the package to a directory (or folder) of its own.
   The zip file contains a directory, but you need not use that directory.<br>
   Windows&nbsp;NT/2000/XP users are likely to need a driver for copier I/O. You
   do not need a driver if you use Windows&nbsp;95, 98 or ME. A driver is also
   not needed when you will not use uCON64 to communicate with a backup unit.<br>
   You could use a driver like UserPort, DlPortIO, io.dll or inpout32.dll.
<!-- UserPort doesn't seem to have an official homepage. -->
   You can download DlPortIO at
   <a href="http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/dnload.htm#Windows%2095/NT%20Port%20I/O%20Driver" target="_blank">
   http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/dnload.htm#Windows%2095/NT%20Port%20I/O%20Driver</a>, directly at
   <a href="http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/DlPortIO.htm" target="_blank">
   http://www.driverlinx.com/DownLoad/DlPortIO.htm</a> or from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64 homepage</a>.
   You can find io.dll in a file named io.zip at
   <a href="http://www.geekhideout.com/iodll.shtml" target="_blank">
   http://www.geekhideout.com/iodll.shtml</a> and you can find inpout32.dll in
   a file named inpout32_source_and_bins.zip at
   <a href="http://www.logix4u.net" target="_blank">http://www.logix4u.net</a>.
   UserPort and io.dll are included with the binary release. We recommend
   DlPortIO and io.dll. To install DlPortIO simply start port95nt.exe. After the
   installation is completed, copy DLPORTIO.dll from the Windows system(32)
   directory to uCON64's configuration directory. To install io.dll or
   inpout32.dll, put them in uCON64's configuration directory. See the section
   <a href="#configbin">"How to configure the uCON64 executable"</a> for more
   information about the configuration directory.<br>
   uCON64 displays a message if it finds DLPORTIO.dll, io.dll or inpout32.dll
   before communicating with a copier. It displays this message before it
   displays file information, so you might want to use the command line switch
   -q. Only the Windows versions of uCON64 are able to use DLPORTIO.dll, io.dll
   or inpout32.dll. If more than one I/O driver is present in the configuration
   directory, uCON64 will first try to load DLPORTIO.dll. If that fails it will
   try to load io.dll. If that also fails it will try to load inpout32.dll.<br>
   It <i>is</i> possible to use the DOS version of uCON64 as a transfer tool
   under Windows&nbsp;XP without UserPort. We have received reports from people
   who were able to send and receive ROMs under Windows&nbsp;XP as a regular
   user (no Administrator rights and not "Power Users").<br>
<br>
<a name="cmdline">The command line environment<br></a>
   uCON64 is a command line program and is usually started from a program like
   command.com (Windows&nbsp;9x/ME) or cmd.exe (Windows&nbsp;NT/2000/XP). You
   can start command.com or cmd.exe by choosing the option "Run..." from the
   start menu. You have to type the word command.com or cmd.exe yourself.
   Command.com and cmd.exe are command line interpreters. That means that they
   will try to interpret any command you type followed by a press on the enter
   or return key. When you type a command, the command line interpreter will
   first look in the current directory and if it cannot find a program file
   with the correct name it will search the so-called "path". This means that
   the program file of uCON64 (ucon64.exe) must either be present in the
   current directory or in one of the directories of your path. It is really
   comfortable to have ucon64.exe present in your path, because you can simply
   use the name ucon64 from any directory without first having to copy
   ucon64.exe to that directory.<br>
   The path is defined by the environment variable PATH. You can check the
   current value of that variable with the command:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; echo %PATH%<br>
   You could copy uCON64 to one of those directories. However, we recommend
   putting ucon64.exe in a directory of its own (on Windows). So, you should
   modify the value of PATH. On Windows&nbsp;9x/ME you should do that in the
   following way. Edit the file c:\autoexec.bat and add a line like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; set PATH=%PATH%;c:\ucon64<br>
   Replace c:\ucon64 with the drive and directory where you extracted the
   uCON64 files to. Save the modified c:\autoexec.bat and reboot.
   On Windows&nbsp;XP (NT/2000?) you should press the buttons or icons start
   -&#62; Control Panel -&#62; System -&#62; Advanced -&#62; Environment
   Variables and edit the value of path in the section System variables or
   else in the section User variables. You have to start a new instance of
   cmd.exe before the changes take effect.
   After you have made your changes (and have rebooted your PC if you are using
   Windows&nbsp;9x/ME or DOS) check the value of PATH again. It should now list
   the directory you just added.<br>
   For information on how to use the command line see
   <a href="#49">question 49</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="configbin"><b>How to configure the uCON64 executable</b></a><br>
   First run uCON64 once. Use a command like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -version<br>
   If you have not run uCON64 before you should see a message that it created
   a file with a name like ucon64.cfg (DOS version) or .ucon64rc (all other
   versions). If you are using GNU/Linux and uCON64 crashes see
   <a href="#46">question 46</a>.<br>
   Then search for the line that starts with "configuration file". It should
   say "present" between the parentheses. The file name after the colon is the
   name of the configuration file. The configuration file may contain names of
   variables that influence the behaviour of uCON64. Here follows a table of
   the variable names uCON64 recognises:<br>

   Each of these variables can also be set in the command line environment. If
   they are they take precedence over the values set in the configuration file.
   For example, if you set the environment variable ansi_color to 0 while the
   configuration file sets it to 1 uCON64 will not use color. In command.com or
   cmd.exe you can set an environment variable with the command "set", in Bash
   you should do it with the command "export". For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; export ansi_color=0<br>
   Some variables can be overruled with command line switches. For example, to
   disable the use of color even if both the configuration file and the
   environment have the variable ansi_color set to 1, use the switch -ncol:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 "Rock Fall (PD).zip" -ncol<br>
   The variable ucon64_configdir is only really important for the Windows
   versions of uCON64. To install the I/O port driver io.dll or inpout32.dll
   place it (or both) in the directory that uCON64 lists as its configuration
   directory.<br>
   If you use DOS or Windows&nbsp;9x and do not want uCON64 to create
   ucon64.cfg or .ucon64rc files all over the place (current directories) see
   <a href="#25">question 25</a>.<br>
   You might also want to make use of DAT files. See
   <a href="#36">question 36</a> for more information.<br>

<p>
<a name="6"><b>Q6</b>: How do I make uCON64 only display information about a
   ROM?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If you want to display information about a ROM just run uCON64 with
   the name of the ROM as the only argument. Sometimes you will have to specify
   the console type for uCON64, because the ROM dump is damaged or simply not
   detected correctly by uCON64. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -snes "Super Aleste (J) [t1].swc"<br>

<a name="7"><b>Q7</b>: I have two parallel ports in my PC and my Flash Advance
   Linker is connected to the second. However, when I try to use uCON64 to send
   a demo to the FAL something goes wrong. What happened?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Well, many things could have gone wrong, but uCON64 only detects your
   first parallel port (it stops probing for a parallel port if it finds one).
   So, you should specify the address of the second parallel port on the
   command line. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfal demo.gba -port 0x278<br>
<br>
   The I/O address of the parallel port could be 0x3bc, 0x378 or 0x278. If you
   do not want to type the address of the parallel port every time you want to
   transfer something to your FAL (or another copier) edit .ucon64rc or
   ucon64.cfg (for the DOS version) and remove the hash symbol in front of the
   line that starts with "parport=" (without the quotes). If that line is not
   present add one. You do not have to use the prefix 0x. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; parport=278<br>
   You can also set an environment variable with the name parport to the right
   value. The value of the environment variable takes precedence over the value
   in the configuration file.<br>

   parallel cable, i.e., a cable with male DB-25 connectors at both ends where
   the pins are connected in the following way:<br>
   pin 1&nbsp; &#60;-&#62; pin 1<br>

<a name="9"><b>Q9</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which GoodSNES says it is good, but
   uCON64 says it is bad. Who is right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: It depends.<br>
   If uCON64 displays the text "Checksum: Bad" GoodSNES might be right.<br>
   There may be several reasons why uCON64 reports that the check sum is bad.
   It could have made a mistake while determining if the ROM is a HiROM or a
   LoROM dump. Try the switches -hi and -nhi and see if uCON64 reports the
   check sum differently. Sometimes ROM dumps are detected as not being
   interleaved while they actually are. Try the switches -int and -int2 and see
   if you get better results. It could also be that uCON64 detects the ROM as
   interleaved while it is not. The switch -nint might help in that case. If
   the check sum is reported as good it is likely that the ROM is really good.
   Alternatively, you may want to convert the ROM to a non-interleaved format
   with -dint and run uCON64 on the converted ROM. Luckily you will not find
   many interleaved ROM dumps that uCON64 cannot handle, probably because
   Snes9x and ZSNES often cannot handle them either.<br>
   Perhaps "Ok" looks nicer than "Bad", but it is far more important that
   uCON64 displays DAT file information. If you installed a SNES DAT file (see
   <a href="#36">question 36</a>) and uCON64 does not display a line with the
   text "DAT info:" then the ROM dump could not be identified. It could be that
   you  have an unknown ROM dump, but it is more likely that you have a modified
   (i.e. bad) dump or an overdump. GoodSNES 0.999.5 does not use the CRC32 to
   identify files, so if uCON64 does not display DAT info, but GoodSNES
   identified it as good then uCON64 is right. For reasons see
   <a href="#42">question 42</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="10"><b>Q10</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which Snes9x and ZSNES say it is
   bad, but uCON64 says it is good ("Checksum: Ok"). Who is right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64, probably :-)<br>
   Neither Snes9x 1.39 nor ZSNES 1.36 calculate the check sum correctly for BS
   ROMs, so you can be pretty sure the ROM is good if it is a BS ROM. See
   previous answer.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="11"><b>Q11</b>: I have a SNES ROM of which uCON64 said it was bad, so
   I used the -chk option. Now uCON64, Snes9x and ZSNES all say the ROM is
   good, but GoodSNES still says it is bad. How can that be, I did fix the ROM,
   right?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: No, you did not. When you use -chk uCON64 changes four bytes in the
   ROM dump, so that they match with the calculated check sum. However, the ROM
   stays just as bad as it was.<br>
   Use -chk with care. -chk might be useful if you want to store a ROM
   somewhere without using a database with its check sum. You can then later
   check if the ROM is still the same as it was when you stored it by using the
   check sum that is stored in the ROM.<br>
   That said, it is a <i>much</i> better idea to create a DAT file from your
   ROM collection if you plan to store it somewhere. See
   <a href="#42">question 42</a> for reasons and <a href="#43">question 43</a>
   for information on how to create a DAT file.<br>

<a name="12"><b>Q12</b>: Some SNES games do not work on my Super Wild Card.
   What can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can do several things. First make sure the original game
   cartridge does not contain any special chips that your Super Wild Card
   does not support (look at the ROM type information). For example, if you are
   trying to run a game like Super Mario Kart (which uses a DSP chip) your
   Super Wild Card should have an extension with the correct DSP chip (or have
   the right cartridge with that chip plugged in your SWC). Then make sure you
   are using a good dump (look at the check sum information). After you have
   done that, check if the file is interleaved (look at the line that starts
   with "Interleaved/Swapped:"). If the file is interleaved convert it to Super
   Wild Card format (deinterleaved) by using the option -swc. Also verify that
   the backup unit header is correct. The option -dbuh can be helpful with
   that. You can make uCON64 rewrite the header also with -swc. uCON64 uses the
   information in the ROM dump's header when sending the file to the Super Wild
   Card, so this is important! You can also try to rewrite the header while
   using one of the switches -hi or -nhi to force uCON64 to handle it as a
   HiROM or a LoROM dump. Additionally you could use one of the switches -hd,
   -nhd or -hdn to specify the backup unit header size. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc -nhi -hd "Batman Revenge of the Joker (U).swc"<br>
   There are many (good) ROMs on the internet with incorrect headers, so this
   might well solve the problem.<br>
   Several games contain a copy protection that prevents them from running on
   a backup unit, so this can also be a reason why the game does not work. You
   can try -k to remove that protection. Several games also check if they are
   running on a PAL or an NTSC SNES. Use -f to remove that form of copy
   protection. Some other games check the ROM speed. You can use -l for those.
   Some games have more than one type of copy protection, so it could be
   necessary to use uCON64 several times with a different option.<br>
   See <a href="#39">question 39</a> and <a href="#40">question 40</a> for more
   information about a new feature in uCON64 1.9.8beta8 that can be used to
   update or improve the options -k, -f and -l without having to (re)compile
   the source code.<br>
<br>
   Some games seem to work, but after a while it becomes clear that they do not
   run as was intended. Two examples of such games are Demon's Crest and Mega
   Man X. Here follows an explanation on how to get them to work. All credits
   go to Gideon Zhi for sharing this info on cherryroms. Start with ROM images
   in SWC format.<br>
<br>
   Demon's Crest:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -stp "Demon's Crest.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cat "Demon's Crest.swc" "Demon's Crest.swc" &#62; "Demon's Crest (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc "Demon's Crest (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   Mega Man X:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -stp "Mega Man X.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -padn=2097152 "Mega Man X.swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; cat "Mega Man X.swc" "Mega Man X.swc" &#62; "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -swc "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   WinDOS users without the program cat should use the command copy. For
   example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; copy /b "Mega Man X.swc" + "Mega Man X.swc" "Mega Man X (SWC-fix).swc"<br>
<br>
   However, starting from version 1.9.8beta6 the method described above is not
   necessary anymore for Demon's Crest. Use the option -k instead. For
   Mega Man X you will need version 1.9.8beta7 or later.<br>

<b>A</b>: The pipe symbol ('|') should be read as "or".<br>
   The square brackets indicate that "ROM|IMAGE|SRAM|FILE|DIR|ARCHIVE" is
   optional. For many options you have to specify either a ROM or a CD image or
   an SRAM file or some other file or a directory or an archive. However, there

<a name="21"><b>Q21</b>: What is the difference between the Flash Advance

<b>A</b>: When saving -xfals saves all 256 kB while -xfalb &#60;n&#62; saves
   only the 64 kB of bank n. When restoring -xfals starts restoring the SRAM in
   bank 1 while -xfalb &#60;n&#62; starts in bank n. For example, if you have
   Super Mario Advance 2 (J) on your flash card in "ROM bank" 4 and would like
   to save/restore SRAM bank 4 you should do something like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfalb 4 "Super Mario Advance 2 (J).sav"<br>
   The file size determines how many bytes are restored, even when you use
   -xfalb &#60;n&#62;. So, if the file is greater than 64 kB more than one bank
   will be written to.<br>

<a name="22"><b>Q22</b>: uCON64 exits with the message "ERROR: Flash card erase

   wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: The multi-game file you created is too large for your flash card. When
   you make a multi-game file do not forget that the loader or "game pack" file
   also needs some space (32 kB) on the flash card. Do not pass a size to -multi
   that is larger than your flash card. Passing a smaller size is correct
   though. For example, to create a multi-game file that fits on a 128 Mb (16
   MB) card use a command line like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -gba -multi=128 loader.bin rom1.gba rom2.gba rom3.gba rom4.gba multi.bin<br>
   You can also send it directly by using -xfalmulti:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -xfalmulti=128 rom1.gba rom2.gba rom3.gba rom4.gba<br>
   Please note that when using -multi you have to specify a loader and the name
   of the multi-game file to create, while when using -xfalmulti you must omit
   them. -xfalmulti uses the variable gbaloader to find the loader. See
   <a href="#configbin">"How to configure the uCON64 executable"</a>.<br>
   Just like sometimes happens with Visoly's tool it is possible to get the
   same message when the multi-game file is small enough. It will probably work when

   Visoly's site</a>. It is in a file with a name like
   <a href="http://www.visoly.com/download/preboot32.zip">preboot32.zip</a>.
   You can find it also on the uCON64 homepage.<br>

<a name="24"><b>Q24</b>: What is the meaning of the -col option (SNES)?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Back in the days stupid people released games with green blood.
   You can use a GFX or HTML editor to find an identical green color and
   write down the color values in HTML style (#RRGGBB). Now you run
   "ucon64 -col #RRGGBB" and it will calculate the hex value for the
   corresponding SNES color. Ok? No? Then you do not need this option :-)<br>

<a name="25"><b>Q25</b>: Why does uCON64 create ucon64.cfg (DOS executable) or
   .ucon64rc (Win32 executable) files all over the place under DOS and
   Windows&nbsp;9x (command.com)?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64 needs to know where it can find the configuration file or a
   directory where it can create one. It checks the environment for a variable
   with the name UCON64_HOME, HOME, USERPROFILE or HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH (in
   that order). Under Unix HOME is normally set. Under Windows&nbsp;XP and 2000
   (NT?) USERPROFILE, HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are usually set. If uCON64 cannot
   find one of those environment variables it will look for the configuration
   file in the current directory. If it cannot find a configuration file it
   will create one. Under DOS and Windows&nbsp;9x none of those environment
   variables are usually set. So, if you run uCON64 under DOS or
   Windows&nbsp;9x in a directory where no configuration file exists it will
   create one there. If you do not like this behaviour you should set one of
   the mentioned environment variables yourself. You can do that by adding the
   following line to the end of the file c:\autoexec.bat:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; set UCON64_HOME=c:\ucon64<br>
   and reboot. You can also type that line on the command line. The directory
   c:\ucon64 must exist, of course. If you want uCON64 to use another directory
   you should change c:\ucon64 to a directory of your choice. You should not
   let the last character of the environment variable be a forward or backward
   slash.<br>
   If you have Cygwin installed, the Cygwin runtime system will create an
   internal environment for the uCON64 executable with HOME set to Cygwin's
   home directory if it has not already been set. You can override this value
   with the method mentioned earlier. However, if you set UCON64_HOME this does
   not matter as the value of HOME will not be checked if UCON64_HOME is set.<br>
   You can check which configuration file uCON64 uses by specifying the option
   -version on the command line.<br>
<br>

<a name="26"><b>Q26</b>: When I try to create a multi-game file under Windows I
   get the message "The system cannot execute the specified program." (or
   something similar). What does that mean?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can get that message with the DOS executable if you pass more
   than 127 characters as argument to uCON64. There are two solutions:<br>
   1.) Use a Win32 executable (download one from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64
   homepage</a>).<br>
   2.) Rename the ROMs so that their combined names are short enough to fit
   into 127 characters.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="27"><b>Q27</b>: I tried to run a Win32 executable of uCON64 but Windows
   gave an error message that cygwin1.dll, cygz.dll or zlib.dll could
   not be found.</a><br>
<b>A</b>: The Cygwin-compiled Win32 executable of uCON64 needs cygwin1.dll and
   cygz.dll in order to run. The Visual C++-compiled Win32 executable needs
   zlib.dll. You can download these files from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64 homepage</a>.
   Copy the file(s) to the same directory as the uCON64 executable or to a
   directory in your PATH.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="28"><b>Q28</b>: How do I make uCON64 display one help screen at a
   time?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Just as is stated in the last few lines of the help, pass the output
   of uCON64 to a program that waits for a key after one screen of text. You
   could use the program "more". In order to pass the output of uCON64 to more
   you have to use the pipe symbol, '|'. On an international keyboard you can
   type this symbol with the same key you use for the backslash ('\'). For
   example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -help|more<br>
   To get only help on the options for a specific console, specify the console
   on the command line. For example, to see only the help on Game Boy Advance
   options:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -help -gba|more<br>
   Press the space bar to see the next help screen, the enter key to see the
   next line or q to quit.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="29"><b>Q29</b>: I tried to send a ROM dump to my copier under
   Windows&nbsp;XP (NT/2000), but uCON64 crashed. What is wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If the message looks like this (for the Win32 (Cygwin) executable):<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 [main] ucon64 356 handle_exceptions: Exception: STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION<br>
   5570 [main] ucon64 356 open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to ucon64.exe.stackdump<br>
   or like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Illegal instruction (core dumped)<br>
   then you did not install an I/O driver (correctly). In this case "install"
   means that the I/O driver is running at the time uCON64 tries to access the
   parallel port. See <a href="#4">question 4</a>.<br>
   You will also see this message (with a Windows version of uCON64) if you
   tried to enable EPP mode for the FAL under Windows XP (NT/2000) , i.e., you
   specified the switch -xfalm, without an appropriate I/O port driver.
   UserPort is <i>inappropriate</i> for this, because it enables access to I/O
   ports up to 0x3ff. However, in order to enable EPP mode the FAL code tries
   to access an I/O port with an address higher than 0x3ff. If you want to be
   able to use EPP mode try io.dll or inpout32.dll.<br>
   Starting with version 2.0.0 uCON64 will not crash anymore if it cannot
   access the parallel port at start up (unless you use UserPort in combination
   with a Windows version of uCON64).<br>

<a name="30"><b>Q30</b>: I want to convert a NES ROM in iNES format to UNIF.
   How do I know what board name to use?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: The file
   <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ucon64/ucon64/src/console/boardtable.txt?view=markup" target="_blank">
   boardtable.txt</a> contains a table where you can find what game uses what
   board. The file
   <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/ucon64/ucon64/src/console/boardnames?view=markup" target="_blank">

<p>
<a name="31"><b>Q31</b>: How do I convert a NES ROM from Pasofami to FFE? Or
   from UNIF to Pasofami?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Use iNES as intermediate format. So, to do the conversion Pasofami
   -&#62; FFE, do this conversion instead: first Pasofami -&#62; iNES and then
   iNES -&#62; FFE.<br>
   To answer the second question, to do the conversion UNIF -&#62; Pasofami do
   this: UNIF -&#62; iNES and then iNES -&#62; Pasofami.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="32"><b>Q32</b>: How do I specify dumper information when converting to
   UNIF?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Create a text file with three lines. The first line should contain
   the name (or "handle") of the person who dumped the cartridge. This line may
   be 99 characters long at maximum. The next line should contain the date when
   the cartridge was dumped. The format is dd-mm-yyyy. Instead of the hyphen
   ('-') you may also use the slash ('/'). If day or month is smaller than 10
   you may use 1 or 2 digits, for example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 02/02/2002<br>
   or<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2-2-2002<br>
   The third and last line should contain information about the dumping means
   that was used. This line may also contain 99 characters at maximum. Here is
   an example info file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Dirk &#60;noisyb@gmx.net&#62;<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 26-7-2002<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; Custom built hardware<br>
   To get this information in a UNIF file, you should use the -dumpinfo switch
   in combination with the -unif option. Say you store the dumper information
   in the file info.txt. This would get the info in a UNIF file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.nes -mapr NROM -dumpinfo info.txt<br>
   If you already have a UNIF file the command line looks almost the same:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.unf -dumpinfo info.txt<br>
   For an existing UNIF file you need not specify the board name, but you might
   want to specify it if you want to change the board name in the file.
   Afterwards run uCON64 on the newly written ROM to see if you were
   successful. uCON64's display output should contain a dump info section then.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="33"><b>Q33</b>: How do I specify that a NES game in UNIF format
   supports multiple controller types?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Use the -ctrl switch multiple times on the <i>same</i> command line.
   For example, to specify that a game supports the controller types "regular
   joypad" and "power pad" you should use a command line like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -unif smb.nes -mapr NROM -ctrl 0 -ctrl 4<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="34"><b>Q34</b>: How do I enable or disable colors in the display
   output of uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: For the Windows and Unix executables colors are enabled by default.
   For the DOS executable ANSI.SYS must be loaded. Under DOS and
   Windows&nbsp;9x ANSI.SYS can be loaded by adding a line to the end of
   c:\config.sys of the format "device=&#60;full path to ANSI.SYS&#62;".
   Say ANSI.SYS is located in the directory c:\windows\command, then the line
   would have to look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; device=c:\windows\command\ansi.sys<br>
   Changes made to config.sys under DOS and Windows&nbsp;9x will become active
   only after a reboot.<br>
   Under Windows&nbsp;XP/NT you should add a similar line to your
   %SystemRoot%\system32\CONFIG.NT:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; device=%SystemRoot%\system32\ansi.sys<br>
   The use of color can be disabled by specifying the switch -ncol on the
   command line. You can also add the following line to the configuration file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ansi_color=0<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="35"><b>Q35</b>: When I try to convert a large number of files using
   wildcards, uCON64 will only convert the first file. Is this a bug?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: No, it is not. uCON64 versions before 1.9.8beta7 just do not support
   wildcards. For example, to convert all files with the suffix (M$ speak:
   extension) .mgd to Super Wild Card format, try this in Bash:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; find -name \*.mgd -exec ucon64 --snes --swc {} \;<br>
   or this in command.com or cmd.exe:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; for %f in (*.mgd) do ucon64 --snes --swc "%f"<br>
   However, this functionality has been added to uCON64 1.9.8beta7. With that
   version you can do the same thing with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 --snes --swc *.mgd<br>
   In case something goes terribly wrong and uCON64 crashes it might still be
   necessary to use one of the previous methods, because every file will be
   processed and not only the files before the crash.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="36"><b>Q36</b>: Does uCON64 support DAT (RomCenter/GoodXXXX) files?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Yes, starting with version 1.9.8beta8 it does. First use the option
   -version to see which configuration file uCON64 uses
   (see <a href="#25">question 25</a>). Then open that file in an editor and
   look for a line that starts with "ucon64_datdir=" (without the quotes). If
   that line is not present add one. For example on Unix:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64_datdir=~/.ucon64/dat<br>
   or on Windows:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64_datdir=c:\ucon64\dat<br>
   You can use the tilde ('~') also on DOS and Windows. It will be interpreted
   by uCON64 as the "home directory". The home directory is the directory
   specified by the environment variable HOME or USERPROFILE or HOMEDRIVE and
   HOMEPATH. If none of those environment variables are set, the current
   directory will be handled as the home directory. Again, see
   <a href="#25">question 25</a>.<br>
   You can also set an environment variable with the name ucon64_datdir. The
   value of the environment variable takes precedence over the value in the
   configuration file.<br>
   Then copy all DAT files you have into that directory. You can download DAT
   files from sites like
   <a href="http://emulationrealm.com/rcdat.php#Cowering_GoodTools" target="_blank">
   http://emulationrealm.com/</a>,
   <a href="http://www.romcenter.com/" target="_blank">
   http://www.romcenter.com/</a> or
   <a href="http://www.rommanager.com/" target="_blank">
   http://www.rommanager.com/</a>. You can also find some DAT files on
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/index.html#ucon64dat" target="_blank">
   the uCON64 homepage</a>.<br>
   uCON64 will automatically create index files which speed up the access to
   the DAT files dramatically. Now uCON64 uses the information inside the DAT
   files to identify or rename ROMs without an internal header.<br>
   Starting with version 1.9.8beta8 uCON64 does not have an internal database
   anymore, so you will <b>need</b> DAT files for files like NES ROM dumps.<br>
   You can check which DAT files are used by uCON64 with the option -db. You
   can view or list all DAT entries with the option -dbv. You can search for a
   specific CRC32 value with the option -dbs. The force-console-type options
   can be used in combination with -db, -dbv and -dbs. For example, to see
   which DAT files are used to identify SNES ROM dumps, type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 -db -snes<br>
   If uCON64 reports that it found 0 DAT files you did not install the DAT
   file(s) correctly.<br>
<br>

<a name="37"><b>Q37</b>: Some SNES games do not work on my Super Pro Fighter
   Q(+). What can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: First read the answer to <a href="#12">question 12</a>.
   Starting with versions after 1.9.8beta8 you can send (and dump) games with
   the option -xfig. It could be that some games need to be in Super Wild Card
   format in order for them to work correctly what SRAM concerns if you load
   them from diskette. So, instead of converting them with -fig you have to use
   the option -swc. For example Earthbound and "Lufia &amp; The Fortress of
   Doom" have all sorts of problems when they are in FIG format, but not when
   they are in SWC format. Other games work best when you convert them with
   -fig. For example Seiken Densetsu 3 will run best when converted with -fig.<br>
   There seems to be a bit of an overheating problem with some Super Pro
   Fighter Q(+) models. After playing half an hour or so, this may result in
   reboots or other strange behaviour. We have received a report of one user
   who solved this by removing the case of the Super Pro Fighter Q(+) and
   placing a CPU fan on top of the SPFQ's RAM chips.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="38"><b>Q38</b>: uCON64 displays too many lines for my DOS-box. What
   can I do about that?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: You can do several things:<br>
   1.) Change the number of lines that can be displayed at once with this
   command:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; mode con lines=50<br>
   2.) Use the program "more". See <a href="#28">question 28</a>.<br>
   3.) Redirect the output of uCON64 to a file. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; ucon64 rom.swc &#62; output.txt<br>
   You can then open the file output.txt in an editor.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="39"><b>Q39</b>: When will the next version of uCON64 be released? I
   have heard the next version is able to crack my favourite SNES game, but I
   do not know how to use CVS or a compiler.</a><br>
<b>A</b>: We know when we will release a new version only just before we do so.
   But starting with uCON64 1.9.8beta8 this is not a problem for you at all.
   The only requirement is that you are able to read and use a text editor ;-)<br>
   First visit the uCON64 homepage and from there follow a link to the
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ucon64" target="_blank">
   uCON64 SourceForge page</a>. You should be able to find a page where you can
   browse the CVS repository. Download the latest version of the file snes.c.
   Open the file in an editor and search for the text snes_k. If you are
   looking for NTSC or PAL fixes search either for snes_fix_pal_protection or
   snes_fix_ntsc_protection, depending on what you need. For example, you will
   have to search for snes_fix_pal_protection, if you want to fix a game so
   that it will run on an NTSC SNES.<br>
   Then read the comment to see what "code" your game requires. However, surely
   not every game will be mentioned in the comments. In that case search for
   the corresponding "line" a bit below. For example, for Mega Man X you will
   find this text in the comments:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; af/bf XX 80 00 cf/df XX 80 40 f0<br>
   =&#62; af/bf XX 80 00 cf/df XX 80 40 80<br>
   Then you could search for the sequence \x80\x40\xf0. It is just a subset of
   the search pattern with each element prefixed with "\x". Searching for
   \xaf/\xbf will not bring you far. Searching for \xXX\x80 neither. It takes a
   bit too much text to explain all the details, so just follow the directions.
   Note that I did not advise to search for \x80\x40\x80, because that is what
   the sequence should be after uCON64 has cracked or fixed the game.<br>
   For Mega Man X you will find the lines:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; n += change_mem (buffer, bytesread, "!*\x80\x00!*\x80\x40\xf0", 9, '*', '!', "\x80", 1, 0,<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                 "\xaf\xbf", 2, "\xcf\xdf", 2);<br>
   Now open the file snescopy.txt. If you are trying to get uCON64 support new
   NTSC or PAL cracks open snesntsc.txt or snespal.txt respectively. Then copy
   the parts "!*\x80\x00!*\x80\x40\xf0", '*', '!', "\x80", 0, "\xaf\xbf" and
   "\xcf\xdf" to a new line in that file. Note that 0 is the 9th parameter.
   Also note that "\xaf\xbf" and "\xcf\xdf" are all parameters between double
   quotes after the 9th parameter.<br>
   Remove the double and single quotes and separate the parts by a colon. Then
   replace the prefix \x with a space. If you followed the directions the line
   will look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; !* 80 00!* 80 40 f0: *: !:  80: 0:  af bf:  cf df<br>
   You are almost done now. Only one thing has to be done. Look at what the
   "wildcard" and "escape" symbols are. They are defined by the 5th and 6th
   parameter of change_mem(), respectively. In our example the 5th parameter is
   '*', so the wildcard character is: *. The 6th parameter is '!', so the
   escape character is: !. And now the last step: replace the wildcard and
   escape characters with a (hexadecimal) number that does not occur in the
   rest of the character sequence (except other wildcards and escape symbols or
   values). Be sure to have at least one space between the numbers. In our
   example we could choose the values 1 and 2. In that case the finished line
   would look like this:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 1 80 00 2 1 80 40 f0: 1: 2:  80: 0:  af bf:  cf df<br>
   If for example the 5th parameter would have been \x01, the wildcard would be
   01. In that case you would not have to change it, because it is already a
   number.<br>
   Now save the changed file and place it either in the directory from where
   you will run uCON64 (this is not necessarily the same directory as the one
   where the uCON64 executable might be located!) or in uCON64's configuration
   directory. Use the option -version to find out which directory that is. Then
   try if uCON64 is able to crack your game. uCON64 will display a warning
   message if it detects an error in your new line. If you made a mistake with
   escape symbols uCON64 might very well crash. You can use the switch -v (in
   combination with -k, -f or -l) to make uCON64 display what information it
   reads from the file.<br>
   If you cannot find which line you need you will either have to add a line to
   snescopy.txt, snespal.txt or snesntsc.txt for every code that is not already
   mentioned in those files or ask someone else to do it for you. For example
   on an emulation web forum like
   the <a href="http://www.cherryroms.com/" target="_blank">cherryroms</a>
   <a href="http://forums.cherryroms.com/viewforum.php?f=2" target="_blank">
   copier and hardware forum</a>.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="40"><b>Q40</b>: What is the format of the snes*.txt files?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Zero or more <u>lines</u> of the following format:<br>
   &#60;search&#62; : &#60;wc&#62; : &#60;esc&#62; : &#60;new&#62; : &#60;off&#62;
   [: &#60;set&#62;]*<br>
   Where <i>search</i> is the search pattern, <i>wc</i> the wildcard value,
   <i>esc</i> the escape value, <i>new</i> the replacement byte sequence,
   <i>off</i> the offset and <i>set</i> a set of bytes for each escape value in
   the search pattern. uCON64 does not accept this information to be specified
   across several lines. All values should be specified in hexadecimal, except
   the offset.<br>
   If the search pattern does not contain any escape bytes, you need not specify
   a set as it will not be used. If it does contain escape bytes you will have
   to specify a set for each one of them. Take for example the pattern:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 00 01 00 42 84 ff 75 : ff : 00 : 02 03 : -6 : 22 11 : 19 75<br>
   This will match amongst 1020 others with the following byte sequences:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 22 01 19 42 84 19 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 11 01 19 42 84 91 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 22 01 75 42 84 00 75<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 01 11 01 75 42 84 ff 75<br>
   A wildcard value in the search pattern matches with any value.<br>
   Using the above search pattern, uCON64 will search and replace two bytes six
   bytes "back" from the end of any matched byte sequence.
   For example, any occurence of the byte sequence 01 22 01 19 42 84 19 75 will
   be changed into 01 02 03 19 42 84 19 75.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="41"><b>Q41</b>: Is it possible to force uCON64 to send or dump (an)
   SRAM (file) instead of that it depends on whether the file exists?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: No, but you could use a simple script or batch file to force sending
   or dumping. Here is an example batch file to force dumping SRAM with a Pro
   Fighter:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;@echo off<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if exist %1 goto error<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -xfigs %1<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;goto exit<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;:error<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;echo %1 already exists, use a different name<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;:exit<br>
   Save that text to a file that ends with ".bat" (without the quotes). Say you
   save it to a file named dumpsram.bat. Then you can dump the SRAM of the Pro
   Fighter with a command line like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;dumpsram save1.sav<br>
   You do not have to check if save1.sav exists anymore as the batch file will
   do it for you.<br>
   Here is the Bash script equivalent of the above batch file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/bash<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if [ -e "$1" ]; then<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;echo $1 already exists, use a different name<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;exit<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;fi<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -xfigs "$1"<br>
   You do not have to give the file a specific name. Just do not forget to make
   the file executable. Say you name it dumpsram, then you could make it
   executable with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;chmod +x dumpsram<br>
   Now you can dump the SRAM with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;./dumpsram save1.sav<br>

<a name="42"><b>Q42</b>: Why does uCON64 support DAT files?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: uCON64 supports DAT files for two reasons:<br>
   1.) In order to reliably identify ROM dumps.<br>
   2.) In order to rename ROM dumps to their "official" name.<br>
   Some ROM dump formats contain enough information to identify them, but none
   of the formats supported by uCON64 can be <i>reliably</i> identified.<br>
   The check sum algorithms that are used to calculate the internal check sum
   of the files that have one is a simple addition of a range of bytes. So,
   several bytes can be swapped and still yield the same check sum. Even the
   range can be different and produce the same check sum. The latter case often
   occurs with overdumps. Some ROM dump formats do not even use the entire file
   for the check sum calculation...<br>
   uCON64 solves these problems as it uses the CRC32 algorithm for file
   identification. The CRC32 algorithm will produce a different check sum if
   bytes are swapped or if the range is different. When uCON64 is run on a ROM
   dump it first calculates the CRC32 of that file and then searches in its DAT
   files for that CRC32. If the CRC32 is present uCON64 will display the
   information it found in the DAT file. If uCON64 could not find the CRC32 it
   will not display DAT information.<br>
   At the risk of labouring the obvious I might add that even if all formats
   used a check sum algorithm like CRC32, DAT files would still be necessary as
   it is not possible to reliably identify a file without an external
   reference.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="43"><b>Q43</b>: How should the option --mkdat be used?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: With care ;-)<br>
   Seriously, let me first state that it would not be helpful if people would
   start creating DAT files from their ROM collections and publish them without
   some form of coordination. At the time of this writing (2 June 2003)
   Cowering's GoodXXXX utilities are the standard for most consoles.<br>
   In order to create a DAT file first make sure that all the ROMs you want to
   create a DAT file from, have the name you want them to have. This is
   important as DAT files are used not only for identification, but also for
   renaming files (when using the option --rename). Also make sure all the
   files have a suffix (or "extension"). Then start uCON64 with the --mkdat
   option. For example, to create a DAT file from all the SNES ROM dumps in the
   directory c:\snesrom use a command line like:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 --mkdat=snes-02062003.dat c:\snesrom<br>
   In this case a DAT file named snes-02062003.dat will be created. When you
   copy this file to uCON64's DAT directory uCON64 will use it to identify SNES
   ROMs. Note that the name ends with ".dat". uCON64 will only see DAT files if
   they have a name that ends with ".dat". Note also that the name starts with
   "snes". uCON64 will use all DAT files (in its DAT directory) that start with
   "snes" to identify SNES ROM dumps. The letter case is not important, so you
   could also use a name that starts with "SNES" or "Snes". If you use an
   incorrect name uCON64 will not use the DAT file, but will print a warning
   message each time you run uCON64 on a ROM dump. Here follows a table to see
   which name uCON64 uses for what console:<br>

   You can create a DAT file from a subset of the files in a directory by
   explicitly specifying the files on the command line:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 --mkdat=snes-02062003.dat c:\snesrom\*.swc<br>
   uCON64 uses the first file to determine for which console a DAT file is
   meant. So, if you want to create a DAT file from a set of ROMs of several
   consoles, the first file uCON64 encounters will determine the DAT file type.
   You can do two things in such a case to be sure for which console the
   resulting DAT file will be meant:<br>
   1.) Specify one extra ROM dump as first file on the command line. For
   example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 --mkdat=n64-02062003.dat c:\rom\mario64.v64 c:\rom<br>
   2.) Use a force recognition switch. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 --mkdat=sms-02062003.dat c:\rom --sms<br>
<br>
   The second option should only be used when you are sure all the files are
   for a certain console and uCON64 fails to recognise some.<br>
   You can control what information uCON64 displays when creating a DAT file
   with the switches -v and -q. --mkdat uses three levels of verbosity:<br>
   1.) When the switch -v is specified uCON64 will display a warning if it
   could not determine the console type for a file. uCON64 will also display a
   warning if it encounters a file that has the same CRC32 as a file uCON64
   already processed (a "duplicate").<br>
   2.) When neither -v nor -q is specified uCON64 will display a warning only
   if it finds a duplicate or if the console type of the first file could not
   be determined.<br>
   3.) When -q is specified uCON64 will display a warning only if the console
   type of the first file could not be determined.<br>
<br>
   If you had to specify a first file you could suppress the warning about a
   duplicate by using the switch -q. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 --mkdat=n64-02062003.dat c:\rom\mario64.v64 c:\rom -q<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="44"><b>Q44</b>: What tools do you recommend besides uCON64?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: For SNES, only
   <a href="http://nsrt.edgeemu.com" target="_blank">NSRT</a> (Nach's SNES ROM
   Tools). That is, starting from version 3.0 Release Candidate 1. NSRT has some
   features that uCON64 does not have. The two most interesting features are
   arguably that it is able to fix some hacked ROM dumps and that it has an
   internal database which is spend a lot of effort on to have it contain only
   correct entries (as opposed to GoodSNES and the GoodSNES DAT files). What the
   second feature is concerned let us remind you that the quality of uCON64's
   ROM database support stands or falls with the quality of the DAT files. So,
   if you would create a DAT file of a ROM dump collection processed with NSRT
   uCON64 would get a SNES database that is similar to the one in NSRT. See
   <a href="#43">question 43</a>. Another advantage NSRT has over uCON64 (as
   seen from a SNES user's viewpoint) is that it is written only for SNES. NSRT
   also handles some strange formats that uCON64 does not handle.<br>

<a name="45"><b>Q45</b>: What is an interleaved ROM?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Strictly speaking, interleaved ROMs do not exist. Interleaved ROM
   dumps do. Or perhaps it is better to say ROM dumps in interleaved format.
   The meaning of "interleaved" depends on the console type. Interleaved
   formats exist for NES, Sega Master System, Game Gear, PC-Engine, Genesis,
   SNES and Nintendo 64.<br>
   Deinterleaving is the opposite of interleaving a ROM dump. It is the process
   of converting the data to "binary" format. Binary in the sense as how the
   data (in a cartridge) is presented to the CPU.<br>
   ROM dumps can be interleaved (not for NES) and deinterleaved with uCON64.<br>
<br>
   NES<br>
   NES dumps can contain two types of data, "PRG data" and "CHR data".
   Interleaved NES dumps have the PRG data stored at the even offsets in the
   file and the CHR data at the odd offsets. Non-interleaved dumps first
   contain all the PRG data followed by the CHR data (if present).<br>
   Cannot be interleaved with uCON64.<br>
   Can be deinterleaved with uCON64 using the option -dint.<br>
<br>
   Sega Master System, Game Gear and Genesis<br>
   Interleaved Sega Master System, Game Gear and Genesis dumps are produced by
   the Super Magic Drive and the Multi Game Doctor 2.<br>
   For the SMD: for each block of 16384 bytes of the ROM all bytes at even
   offsets are stored in the upper half of the dumped block. The bytes at odd
   offsets are stored in the lower half. So, each dumped block first contains
   8192 "odd bytes" then 8192 "even bytes".<br>
   For the MGD2: all odd bytes of the file are stored in the first half of the
   file, all even bytes in the second half.<br>
   Can be interleaved with uCON64 using the option -smd or -mgd.<br>
   Can be deinterleaved with uCON64 using the option -bin.<br>
<br>
   PC-Engine<br>
   Interleaved PC-Engine or TurboGrafx-16 dumps are not produced by a specific
   copier. It depends on the HuCARD (PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 game cartridge).
   American HuCARDs produce an interleaved dump, because the 8 data pins are
   reversed compared to Japanese HuCARDs. Perhaps "bit-swapped" is a better
   word to describe the format, but using the word interleaved prevents
   confusion (as bit-swapped implies a non bit-swapped reference).<br>
   Can be interleaved with uCON64 using the option -mgd, making the game
   suitable for a TurboGrafx-16. You can use the option -swap afterwards if you
   want to play the game on a PC-Engine.<br>
   Can be deinterleaved with uCON64 using the option -msg.<br>
<br>
   SNES<br>
   Interleaved SNES dumps are produced by the Game Doctor and the Super UFO
   when dumping a HiROM cartridge. The simplest interleaved format first
   contains all upper halfs of each 64 kB block of the ROM (HiROM "banks"),
   then all lower halfs. There are several interleaved formats, but except for
   one they all share the principle of dividing each 64 kB block in two.<br>
   SNES ROMs contain a block of 48 bytes, some call it the internal SNES
   header, that contains information about the ROM. Information like game name,
   check sum, size and the bank type. There are two bank types, HiROM and LoROM
   (as far as we know these are terms not used by Nintendo). HiROM ROMs have
   banks of 64 kB, LoROM ROMs have banks of 32 kB. The first bank contains the
   internal SNES header at a fixed offset relative to the end of the bank.
   However, because the bank sizes differ for HiROM and LoROM the absolute
   locations differ for the two in non-interleaved dumps. If dumps are
   interleaved the absolute locations are te same.<br>
   The interleaved format was probably introduced so that a copier <i>can</i>
   (the Game Doctor does only if the dump has no header) always check the same
   location in a dump to tell whether it should handle it as a LoROM or a HiROM
   dump.<br>
   Can be interleaved with uCON64 using the option -gd3 or -ufo.<br>
   Can be deinterleaved with uCON64 using the option -dint, but it is
   better to use one of the regular conversion options -smc, -swc, -fig or
   -mgd. Some SNES tools erroneously interleave LoROM dumps. These dumps
   can be deinterleaved with the options -gd3 and -ufo as well as with the
   aformentioned (SNES) options.<br>
<br>
   Nintendo 64<br>
   Interleaved Nintendo 64 dumps are produced by the Doctor V64 and the Doctor
   V64 Junior. Perhaps "byte-swapped" is a better term for Nintendo 64 dumps.
   For each two bytes the first and the second byte are swapped.<br>
   Can be interleaved with uCON64 using the option -v64.<br>
   Can be deinterleaved with uCON64 using the option -dint, but it is better to
   use the regular conversion option -z64.<br>

<a name="46"><b>Q46</b>: The pre-compiled GNU/Linux binary does not work on my
   system, while a binary compiled by me works fine. How can that be?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If you get this output on the command line:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory<br>
   Or when the command "ldd discmage.so" gives output that looks like this:<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;/lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000)<br>
   (note the text "not found") then you are experiencing a binary
   incompatibility problem with the add-on discmage library. You can either
   remove the discmage library from the directory where uCON64 looks for it
   (see <a href="#4">question 4</a>) or compile the library yourself (see
   <a href="#3">question 3</a>).<br>
<br>

<a name="47"><b>Q47</b>: I use Windows XP (NT/2000) and every time I run uCON64
   I get this error message about ntuser.dat. What does it mean?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: If you see lines in the display output of uCON64 that look like
   these:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;Create: ntuser.idx<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR: Can't open "C:\Documents and Settings\Danil\ntuser.dat" for reading<br>
   you should modify the configuration file so that ucon64_datdir points to
   another directory.<br>
   By default uCON64 will use the home directory as the directory where it
   searches for DAT files (the "DAT file directory"). uCON64 handles all files
   in the DAT file directory that have a name that ends with ".dat" as DAT
   files. ntuser.dat seems to be a standard file in a Windows XP user's home
   directory (and should not be removed), but it is not a DAT file for use with
   uCON64. See <a href="#36">question 36</a> for more information on how to
   configure uCON64 so that it uses "real" DAT files. If you only want to get
   rid of that error message either make ucon64_datdir in the configuration
   file point to an existing directory that does not contain any files with a
   name that ends with ".dat" or make an environment variable with the name
   ucon64_datdir point to such a directory. Do not forget that the environment
   variable will not be set the next time you start a DOS session.<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="48"><b>Q48</b>: Is there any way to make uCON64 convert a ROM dump to
   Game Doctor SF3/SF6/SF7 format and split it, in one command?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Not directly, but it can be done with the help of a shell script or
   batch file. See <a href="#41">question 41</a> for some information on how to
   make a shell script or batch file run. Here is a Bash script:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;#! /bin/bash<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;usage ()<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  echo "Usage: $0 file_to_convert_and_split"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;  exit<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;GD3DIR="convert"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;SPLITDIR="split"<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if [ ! -n "$1" ]; then usage; fi<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then usage; fi<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if [ ! -e "$GD3DIR" ]; then mkdir "$GD3DIR"; fi<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if [ ! -e "$SPLITDIR" ]; then mkdir "$SPLITDIR"; fi<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -q -s "$GD3DIR"/* -o "$SPLITDIR"<br>
   <br>
   And here is a batch file:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;@echo off<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;set GD3DIR="convert"<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;set SPLITDIR="split"<br>
<br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;if not exist %1 goto usage<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if not exist %GD3DIR% mkdir %GD3DIR%<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;if not exist %SPLITDIR% mkdir %SPLITDIR%<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;del /q %GD3DIR%\*<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;del /q %SPLITDIR%\*<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -q -gd3 %1 -o %GD3DIR%<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -q -s %GD3DIR%\* -o %SPLITDIR%<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;goto exit<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;:usage<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;echo Usage: %0 file_to_convert_and_split<br>
<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;:exit<br>
<br>
   Say you saved the batch file to the name cs.bat, then you can convert a
   file to Game Doctor format and split it with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cs somegame.swc<br>
   Afterwards you can find a file in Game Doctor format in the directory
   convert and the split parts in the directory split. Modify the scripts above
   if you want them to make uCON64 write its output to other directories. Do
   <i>not</i> make GD3DIR or SPLITDIR point to the current directory or to your
   SNES ROM directory as the scripts will remove all files in the directories
   pointed to by GD3DIR or SPLITDIR. Starting with empty directories is the
   main reason why the scripts work (actually, this is only true for GD3DIR).<br>
<br>
<p>
<a name="49"><b>Q49</b>: How do I use the command line?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: There are some commands that are very common when using uCON64. I
   will only explain how to use those. Search the internet if you want to know
   more.<br>
   First read the section <a href="#cmdline">"The command line
   environment"</a>.
   The first principle you should understand is how the space on your
   harddisk(s) is organised. Before an operating system is able to use the
   harddisk it needs to have a <i>file system</i>. A harddisk can contain
   several file systems. When you are using DOS or Windows each file system is
   called a "<i>drive</i>" and gets assigned a drive letter. A file system can
   store files and <i>directories</i>. Directories can be seen as special files
   that themselves "contain" files and directories. By using directories it is
   possible to quickly oversee the structure of a file system and keep it
   organised. Under GNU/Linux file systems are visible in the directory
   structure (e.g. /mnt/windows). With Windows XP it is possible to make
   file systems visible/accessible in the same manner.<br>
   When using the command line there is something called the <i>current
   directory</i>.
   The current directory is like an implicit directory. Several commands and
   programs use the current directory when a directory is not explicitly
   specified. For example, the command <b>dir</b> (Unix: <b>ls</b>) lists the
   contents of a directory. When you do not specify a directory it will list
   the contents of the current directory. You can change the current directory
   with the command <b>cd</b>. For example, to change the current directory to
   "roms" on drive C: type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd c:\roms<br>
   On DOS and Windows there is also a <i>current drive</i>. You can change the
   current drive by specifying the drive letter followed by a colon. For
   example to change the current drive to D: type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;d:<br>
   Under DOS and Windows the current directory is a bit different than it is on
   Unix: each drive has its own current directory. It is possible to change the
   current directory of a drive while the current directory of the current
   drive is not changed. The first example with <b>cd</b> does just that when
   C: is not the current drive. When C: was the current drive you would not
   have to specify the drive letter as the command line interpreter would
   assume you intended to change the current directory of C:. When a text
   refers to the current directory under DOS and Windows the author usually
   means the combination of current drive and current directory. In other
   words, when directed to change the current directory to c:\ucon64 you
   actually have to change the current drive to C: and the current directory on
   C: to ucon64.<br>
   Let us assume you have the following directory structure:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;C:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;+--roms<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;+--snes<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;+--gd3<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;+--n64<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;+--tmp<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;D:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;+--roms<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+--sms<br>
<br>
   To change the current directory (of drive C:) to c:\roms\snes\gd3 type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd c:\roms\snes\gd3<br>
   You can see that each directory is separated from its parent by a backslash
   ('\'). Under Unix (or Bash under Windows) you would refer to the same
   directory by replacing the backslashes with forward slashes and perhaps
   replacing "c:" with the appropriate mount point (e.g.,
   /mnt/windows/roms/snes/gd3). Note that "c:" is a valid directory name on a
   GNU/Linux file system.<br>
   You can refer to the other directories (and files) in a relative manner. Say
   c:\roms\snes contains the file
   Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc. You can make uCON64 display
   information about that file with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 "c:\roms\snes\Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc"<br>
   but also with:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 "..\Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc"<br>
   The quotes are necessary or else uCON64 would handle Secret, of, Mana and
   (U).swc as separate files. This is usual behaviour for command line
   programs, it is not specific to uCON64.<br>
   ".." is a special directory. Each directory contains two special
   directories, "." and "..". "." refers to the current directory, ".." to the
   directory one level higher in the directory structure. For example, to see
   the contents of the directory "roms" you could type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;dir c:\roms<br>
   but also:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;dir ..\..<br>
   Or on Unix:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ls ../..<br>
   c:\roms\snes is called a <i>path</i>. To be more specific, an <i>absolute
   path</i>. It is the path to follow in the directory structure to get to the
   file Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc. "..\.." is a <i>relative
   path</i>. In c:\roms\snes "..\.." refers to another directory than in
   c:\roms\snes\gd3 (c:\ and c:\roms respectively). To change the current
   directory to c:\roms\snes type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd ..<br>
   Say you want to convert Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc to
   Game Doctor format, place the converted file in c:\roms\snes\gd3, split that
   file in pieces, place those pieces in c:\tmp and transfer the pieces to a
   Game Doctor SF7. You could type the following commands:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -gd3 "Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc" -o .\gd3<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -s gd3\sf16Sec -o c:\tmp<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -xgd3 ..\..\tmp\SF16SECA.078<br>
<br>
   Besides <b>dir</b> (Unix: <b>ls</b>) and <b>cd</b> there are some other
   commands that you may find useful:<br>
   <b>del</b> (Unix: <b>rm</b>) to delete or remove a file<br>
   <b>xcopy</b> (Unix: <b>cp</b>) to copy a file<br>
   <b>md</b> (Unix (and Windows): <b>mkdir</b>) to create a directory<br>
   <b>rd</b> (Unix (and Windows): <b>rmdir</b>) to remove a directory<br>
   <b>set</b> (Unix (Bash): <b>export</b>) to set (and export) an environment
   variable<br>
   <b>rmdir</b> cannot remove a directory if there are still files (or
   directories) in it. Under DOS and Windows you can get more information about
   these commands by using the option /?. Under Unix the equivalent is --help.
   For example, if you want to get more information about <b>del</b> you could
   type:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;del /?<br>
<br>
   Here follows a final example that uses the commands mentioned above:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd \<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;md test<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd test<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;xcopy "c:\roms\snes\Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc" mana.swc<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;set parport=378<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -xswc mana.swc<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;del mana.swc<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;cd ..<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;rd test<br>
<br>
   First the current directory is changed to c:\. Then the directory "test" is
   created. Then the current directory is changed to "test". Then the file
   c:\roms\snes\Secret&nbsp;of&nbsp;Mana&nbsp;(U).swc is copied to the file
   mana.swc. Then an environment variable with the name parport is set to the
   value 378. Then uCON64 is used to transfer mana.swc to a Super Wild Card
   while using parallel port address 0x378. Then the file mana.swc is removed.
   Finally the directory "test" is removed.<br>

<a name="50"><b>Q50</b>: I configured uCON64 to use ppdev and tried to send a
   file to my backup unit as a regular user. I got an error message that the
   parallel port device could not be opened. What did I do wrong?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: There are two possibilities:<br>
   1.) You specified an incorrect parallel port device in the configuration
   file.<br>
   In most cases the correct device is /dev/parport0. Only change the device
   name if you are sure /dev/parport0 is not the device associated with the
   parallel port your backup unit is connected to. Try for example /dev/parport1
   or /dev/parport2.<br>
   2.) You do not have the required privileges.<br>
   It is true that regular users can transfer files to and from their backup
   units (without the executable being setuid root), but that does not mean
   <i>any</i> user can do that. It is quite common that only users in the group
   "lp" have access to /dev/parport&#60;n&#62;. So, you should add yourself to
   that group. Say your login name is helanren. Root could use the following
   command to give you the privilege to use /dev/parport0:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;usermod -G `echo \`id -Gn helanren\` | sed "s/ /,/g"`,lp helanren<br>
   Explanation:<br>
   <b>usermod -G &#60;groups&#62; helanren</b> is used to make helanren a member
   of those groups.<br>
   <b>id -Gn helanren</b> lists the groups helanren is currently a member of,
   separated by spaces.<br>
   <b>sed "s/ /,/g"</b> replaces all spaces with commas.<br>

<a name="51"><b>Q51</b>: What do I need to do before I can upload files to my
   Flash 2 Advance?</a><br>
<b>A</b>: Download the package that contains the support files from
   <a href="http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">the uCON64 homepage</a>.
   Extract the package and update the configuration file. See
   <a href="#configbin">"How to configure the uCON64 executable"</a>.
   If you want to use the parallel port version of the F2A, you should set at
   least the variable iclientp. If you want to send multiple files to your F2A,
   also set gbaloader. If you want to see a different background while
   uploading, set ilogo.<br>
   The USB version of the F2A is currently only supported under GNU/Linux. If
   you want to use the USB version, you should set at least the variables
   f2afirmware and iclientu. If you want to send multiple files to your F2A, set
   gbaloader. Additional requirements are:<br>
   - <a href="http://libusb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">libusb</a> (included in recent
   GNU/Linux distributions)<br>
   - usbdevfs has to be mounted (most (?) distributions have usbdevfs mounted by
   default, but you can do it manually with "mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb")<br>
   - if you use Linux 2.4 or older then the EZUSB2131 firmware upload driver has
   to be loaded, see <a href="http://ezusb2131.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://ezusb2131.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
   - if you use Linux 2.5 or later fxload should be present in /sbin<br>
   - you need to have read/write access to /proc/ezusb and /proc/bus/usb, so you
   have to run uCON64 as root (or setuid root) for the USB version of the F2A<br>
<br>
   By default, uCON64 tries to access a parallel port to communicate with an
   F2A. In order to make uCON64 communicate with an F2A connected to a USB port,
   use the switch -port. For example:<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;ucon64 -xf2a "Wario Ware Inc.zip" -port=usb<br>
   uCON64 detects to which USB port the F2A is connected, so you do not have to
   specify a specific port.<br>
