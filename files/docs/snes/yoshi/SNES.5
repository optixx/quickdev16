|The OBJs use a lookup table that contains info on their X and Y position on |
|the screen, their size, if they're flipped vertically or horizontally, their|
|colour, and the actual data.                                                |
|                                                                            |
|The format you need to make the table is as follows:                        |
|                                                                            |
|                                                                            |
|Spr. #   Size   Offset        Explanation                                   |

|                                                 d: Playfield priority.     |
|                                                 e: Pallete #.              |
|         Byte   3             CCCCCCCC           C: Character data.         |
|                                                                            |

|         Byte   6             abcdeeeC           a: Vertical flip.          |

|                                                 e: Pallete #.              |
|         Byte   7             CCCCCCCC           C: Character data.         |
|...and so on...                                                             |

|Continue this table all the way down to OBJ #127 (out of 128). Don't think  |
|you're finished quite yet: There is one more table of data required.        |
|                                                                            |
|2 bits are defined for each OBJ (eg. byte #0 holds the info for OBJ 0, 1, 2,|
|and 3; byte #1 holds the info for OBJ 4, 5, 6, and 7). Therefore, 128/4 is  |
|32 bytes of data for the following table:                                   |
|                                  ab                                        |
|                                  ||____Size toggle bit.                    |
|                                  |_____MSB of X-position bit.              |
|                                                                            |
|So, the 4 bytes/sprites + the block are put into the OAM table by consec-   |
|utive writes to the OAM data register. You first should set the OAM address |
|to $0000, then shove your data into it.                                     |
|                                                                            |
|If you don't set the block after the OAM as well, the results are bad. All  |
|the data for the MSB stuff wouldn't be defined correctly, which would result|
|in your entire OBJ table being wacko. Have atleast some 0's there or a table|
|which you really want to use in the long run.                               |
