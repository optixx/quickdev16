SNES Documentation v2.30: Written by Yoshi
****************************************************************************
        Well, seems like you're interested in the SNES programming world.
 
        First off, learn 65c816 assembly. This document will probably be
        WAY over your head if you don't even understand basic opcodes. I
        don't plan on adding a "how.to.code.in.65c816" section to this
        document, *EVER*. Learn it yourself. I can help you with it, but
        you need to learn the basics yourself. It's worth it in the long-
        run, trust me.
 
        This document currently covers more than ANY other document i've
        ever seen: No, i'm not bragging. I'm stating a fact. I'm proud to be
        the one to release this information, too. I feel everyone has the
        right to know about all of this, especially if they're interested in
        getting a career in the SNES-world.
 
        If you have any information to send me, such as typo comments, or
        information which is "wrong" or *NEW* information, do so! I'm always
        updating this thing: the more the better. It's looking great so
        far, and I plan on keeping the rate-of-progress steady.
 
        For more information about moi, read on! :-)
****************************************************************************
        I'm 17 years old; brown hair, blue/grey eyes. 5 foot 10 inches
        tall (175cm), 145 pounds (62.25kg). I am currently in my 5th
        year of high school (I failed my senior year), attending Corvallis
        High School in Corvallis, Oregon.
 
        I'm currently without a job, but i'd love to do development work
        in a CS-related job, ESPECIALLY SNES-related. I'm available! :-)
 
        In my spare time, I enjoy writing stories (books, if you must know.
        I love writing, so...), SNES documentation (ha ha ha), programming
        (in just about anything and everything), biking, sleeping, sketch-
        ing, and IRCing. You can *ALWAYS* find me on IRC at just about ANY
        time of the day. Leave me a /MSG -info note (which is sent to me
        via EMail, FYI), and i'll get it when I log in to check my mail.

        As of January 24th, 1995, I will be 18 years old. I'm not employed
        (vs. unemployed, where you've actually HAD a job). Dunno what'll
        happen to me. Maybe i'll die. Who knows. I hope to move in with
        a good friend of mine, but i'm too chicken to ask. I'd rather be
        out on the street w/out foot than be told "No you can't" - it's a
        huge flaw in my philosophy... Sorry.
