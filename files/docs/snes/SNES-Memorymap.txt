Introduction:

This is a little document I'm throwing together as I go. It probably has a few innacuracies, but it's certainly better than nothing. 
I became frustrated with the lack of solid knowledge and documentation regarding memory in the SNES, all the other maps 
were very incomplete. So, since I'm building an emulator at the moment, I figured I'd write all this down for posterity.

If you find anything in here that is wrong, or if you have an additions or questions, or suggestions... or if you want to help 
with the emulator, mail me at:

Have fun, and I hope this is helpful.

*--------------------------------------------*

Now that I've given you the overview of the memory layout, perhaps a little explanation would be in order. 
We'll start at 00.0000 and work our way up... in LoROM first, then HiROM - to avoid confusion.

00-3F   0000-1FFF   Shadow RAM

What's going on here? Well, this is RAM that is the same in every bank up to and including 7E. It's the first
8k of System RAM. So, if you write 0x42 to 00.1001, you'll read a 0x42 from 7E.1001. Simple, huh?

00-3F   2000-5FFF   Hardware Registers

This is where you do graphics hardware calls, BIOS calls, DMA calls, and all that stuff. There are lots and 
lots of documents on this, all of them confusing. I may write one later on that clarifies a bunch of stuff, but 
for now I won't go into greater detail, as this is pretty straightforward... read and write values that interact 
with hardware.

00-3F   6000-7FFF   Expansion RAM

This is one of those areas in which I draw a blank. I'm not certain where this RAM is supposed to map, 
whether it is part of system RAM or what. Anybody who wants to clarify the purpose of this area of RAM 
can feel free. I've seen at least two cartridges that access this area...

00-3F   8000-FFFF   32k ROM Chunk
40-7C   0000-7FFF   32k ROM Chunk
    8000-FFFF   32k ROM Chunk

This bears a little explanation. When the LoROM is loaded into memory, this is where it is mapped 
(in a real SNES it isn't "loaded" at all - just mapped). The first 64 32k chunks are loaded into the upper half 
of banks 00-3F. Then, you continue at 40, mapping two (2!) 32k chunks in each bank from 40-7C. This 
should take care of an entire LoROM. I know that theoretically a LoROM could be slightly bigger than this, 
but I've never seen one that is...

7D  0000-FFFF   SRAM

OK, this is pretty obvious. This is where the battery-backed SRAM on cartridges is mapped. Very simple. 
Most have 64kb. DOOM, I've heard, has 256kb. Copiers have 256kb. Simple.

7E  0000-1FFF   Shadow RAM
    2000-FFFF   System RAM
7F  0000-FFFF   System RAM

Also very simple. This is the SNES's 128k of RAM. There, that was easy, right?

80-FF   0000-FFFF   MIRROR!

The upper area of the SNES's addressing space is for "Fast ROM". Games will use this area instead of 
the lower area (they're mapped exactly the same) when they want to run faster. The SNES gains 1Mhz 
of speed this way.

The only thing that is different about the upper area is that the vectors for reset and NMI get stored in 
the FF.FFxx last 32 bytes...

*-------------------------------------------*

LoROM vs. HiROM!

OK, this is the most interesting part of SNES mapping, and also the part where I'm most likely to get 
something wrong. As always, if this is incorrect or confusing, let me know!

00-3F   0000-5FFF   Same as LoROM

00-3F   6000-7FFF   8k SRAM Chunk

00-3F   8000-FFFF   32k ROM Chunk
40-7D   0000-FFFF   64k ROM Chunk

Ok, this is not too hard, with one caveat... the first 64 32k chunks of the HiROM cartridge get loaded 
into 00-3F, and then it REPEATS FROM THE BEGINNING starting at 40.0000, this time going in 64k 
chunks until the end of the file. Now, people are about to start yelling about how this doesn't leave 
room for the last 2 64k chunks of a 32mb ROM. Yes, I know... keep reading.

7E-7F   0000-FFFF   Same as LoROM

Note 7D is no longer the SRAM, which is now in the expansion ram area.

80-FD   0000-FFFF   Same as LoROM

FE-FF   0000-FFFF   64k ROM Chunk

Aha! Here it is... the last two chunks of a 32mb ROM (i.e. Chrono Trigger, etc.) get loaded here. 
Remember as always that the last 16 bytes are for vectors, and you're all set!
