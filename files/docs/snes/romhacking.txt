I. Introduction
---------------


A. Preface
   
        This document was written due to the general lack of thourough
rom hacking documents. Although there are a few available they arent as 
thourough as I needed. Therefore I wrote this to help all "would be"
rom hackers. I also copied extracts of various text on certain 
tools, and I added credit to the author's when due, all other text is by
me and I hope you find this useful. Also I will not cover pasofami hacking
 due to the fact that ines format is more popular.


B. Introduction

        Hacking a ROM in its simplest form is easy. It does, even then,
require alot of time depending on the complexity of the hack you are
doing.  For the truly daring you can even learn how to hack the rom
completely, by this I  mean "change the colors, etc.. even make a whole 
new game" This information is in chapter IV.

       Using this document you "may" learn how to be a great rom hacker
although I'm not promissing  anything. The "information" is here, it's
how you use it that makes the difference.

II. Tools
---------
(A) NES ROM HACKING TOOLS

1. NESticle

        To edit patterns, goto the View/Pattern table, then click 
on a pattern and edit it.Right clicking on a pattern will change 
its attribute (palette), to aid in drawing. If you wish, you can save 
the changes with File/Write VROM, and the VROM will be written directly
to the .NES file, so make back-up copies!!.
( nesticle homepage http://www2.southwind.net/~bldlust/NESticle.html )

2. Hex editor

        Depending on the rom your hacking it may or may not have
text in it to edit. Generally use this for simple hacks, but also
use it for major rom hacking as described later in the document.

3. Xchar 
        
        X-Char is a tile data editor for Nintendo systems.  Tile 
data is both the tile and sprite data of the cartridge.  This
tool allows the user to modify the data to their liking, it
sports an easy to use interface, simple enough for even the
most uninitiated in the ways of ROM editting.  If you can use
a paint program, you can use this.(Planet X Software)
Version 2 allows you to edit roms for many emulator formats:
a) *.nes
b) *.gb
c) *.smc

note: It may support more but the above are all that i've tried.

4. Xlate

       what xlate does is take a table file (created by you) of byte 
equivalencies to characters defined by the rom (companies rarely used ascii 
standards for their text encoding).  with a normal hexeditor, you can't see 
jack shit of text in a rom. with xlate, you can manipulate what bytes define
 the characters, so you can see the text by the way it was meant to be seen 
in the rom. let's take a segment from ff2j, for example. 

8F AC AA AB B7

under a normal hexeditor (ascii), it would look like crap. ≈º¨Ω+ to be exact.
but as i said, squaresoft didn't use standard ascii codes for their text. 
8F means F, AC means i, etc.. it's xlate's job to reallign the text codes 
into something that looks right.

the format for creating a xlate 1.00 table is like this :

<A> <B> <C>
8F   F   F
AA   g   g
AB   h   h
AC   i   i
B7   t   t
...

A: column A is the byte addressed.
B: column B is the key you press to call the letter in column C.
C: column C is the text displayed to us while in xlate, in place of the byte 
in column A.

so, in xlate, when bytes 8F,AC,AA,AB,B7 are addressed, they look like 'Fight
'. ( Extract from Demi's romhacking text )


5. Romhack

      RomHack starts with the File Requester. From there you may choose 
the rom file you want to see. Actually, you can read ANY file, but RomHack
comes handy only with roms! Chosen the rom, the main screen displaying a 
BITwise dump of that rom will pop up. On the bottom of the screen the rom 
filename is displayed. On the top right, we have: the POSition indicator 
into the rom (referred to the first pixel shown on the top-left of the 
screen), the total LENgth of the ROM and the MODulus (or sprites size) value. The modulus
is very important, since it's the key to display things like character-sets
and sprites. The Y modulus works togheter with the X one to help display
graphics with aligned bytes (sprites). The key of sprites dumping is, anyway,
the SPRITES mode. The sprites mode displays bytes in the following format:

byte 1    byte 9
byte 2    byte 10
byte 3    byte 11
byte 4    byte 12
byte 5    byte 13
byte 6    byte 14
byte 7    byte 15
byte 8    byte 16

byte 17   byte 25
byte 18   byte 26
byte 19   byte 27
byte 20   byte 28
byte 21   byte 29
byte 22   byte 30
byte 23   byte 31
byte 24   byte 32

... and so on

It looks like many roms store sprites this way. Of course the X and Y
size of sprites can be fully customizable.

Another neat feature of RomHack is Dump. You can have a real-time dump
of the ROM in HEX, ASCII and 6502 DISASSEMBLY. (Fabrizio Zavagli)

(B) SNES ROM HACKING TOOLS


 1. Ctool v1.62
      
    A) What it can do:

* A whole NEW algorithm to verify SNES checksum!! 
   Old versions of CTOOL only could handle 2,4,8,16 and 32 MBit cartridges. 
   Now CTOOL V1.62 can calculate checksum of 10,12,20 and 24 Mbit carts!
 * Verify option shows blocks left and percentage of process.
 * Split option aborts if destination size equals original size. 
   Old versions of CTOOL created a copy of the file. Fixed!
 * Join option shows the name of the files being joined.
 * When splitting SMC files, the cartridge mode byte -if present- is copied
   to the last file. Reversely, when joining SMC files, the mode byte of the
   last file is copied onto the new file.
 * Transfer option sends cartridge mode byte to SWC !!!!
   This means that we can now send High ROM games to our beloved Wild Card
   and also avoid SRAM protections by changing the header appropiately!
 * Transfer routine has been recoded so that SWC will not get locked when
   the console is powered off. Old versions of CTOOL sometimes needed an
   unlocking program like RESETPRT.COM to bring SWC back alive.
 * Transfer option shows file name, blocks left and percentage of files 
   being sent to the SWC.
 * Another NEW option /m activates "Multi File mode" !!
   Now you don't need to join your files in a full sized one. CTOOL can now
   handle multi splitted SMC files when verifying and sending to the copier!
   If /m flag is not set, smart detection asks you to choose it if needed.
 * Maker ID's identification optimized to half size, as old codes were all
   compatible with new ones. No longer needed to have 2 tables in memory!
 * Some new Maker ID's included and some old ones fixed to real names.
 * Japanese letter 'little tsu' now appears as (k).  (Black Hole)
 
  B) How do I use it:
    
     It is menu driven figure it out.



2. Kill Them 

    A) What is it :

    With this tool you are able to remove up to 95% of all present and up-
    coming PAL, NTSC and SLOWROM Protections!
    The best'n fastest available Fixer 4 your PC! Don't believe it? Just 
    test and make sure.
    
    B) How do I use it:

    Just type at the commandline: KILLEM31 <FILENAME> /<OPTION>

    The options look like this: /1 : for removing PAL-Protections at once
                                /2 : for detecting PAL-Protections and
                                     creating an IPS file to remove 'em
                                /3 : for removing NTSC-Protections at once
                                /4 : for detecting NTSC-Protections and
                                     creating an IPS file to remove 'em
                                /5 : for removing SLOW-Protections at once
                                /6 : for detecting SLOW-Protections and
                                     creating an IPS file to remove 'em

    Use option 1 & 2 only for NTSC-Modules and option 3 & 4 only for PAL-
    Modules. Otherwise it can be that an NTSC game won't work on an NTSC
    Machine and the same with PAL. But the Utility automatically detects
    a NTSC or PAL game, so don't be shy! (Wonderboy)
 
3.  SnesTool

    What it is: Multipurpose tool to modify snes roms(not grafix)

    How do I use it:

*CONFIGURE
This is important for adding headers, sending hi-rom games, and
fixing headers.
First the Printer port (1-4) is asked, if none set 1=default
The function gets the port values from segment 40 (bios variables)

Then it asks ya for 5 different style of copiers, press Y if you
have the correct one, Double profighter works ok, Procom/Magicom also
And the Profighter Q+ 32 mbit is ok as well, the others are NOT tested
yet. So if Hi-rom sending does not work, try some other copiers
instead, there are 5 different types of Hirom Sending.

If you have made your choice, the fileselector gets active, then
choose the SNESTOOL and press return, it will then patch the
snestool.exe file to keep the values you entered. 
You can skip the patching, but why re-enter it everytime huh ?
Changing your settings as many times as you like is no problem 
you can patch the Snestool.exe until you drop..

*TAB
Go to browsing mode, exit with Esc or <TAB> again.
Use this to switch between File-Selector and Menu.

*SPLIT
Pick a snes file, then you can choose the split size for 4/8/12 mbit,
with the arrow keys, press return to start.
It will keep the 1st 8 letters name the extension to 1/2/3/etc..

*JOIN
Will only take *.1 files then renames the file to *.smc.
Works on multiple files.

*SLOWROMFIX
Searches & patches the selected file for some standard fixes.
Number of fixes will be displayed.
Almost fixes the same ones as killem31.
Killem is a little better however, but sometimes fixes a little
too much...

*PALFIX
Search & patch standard protections for games which do not work on
pal machines.

*NTSCFIX
Same but for games that do not work on NTSC machines.
Once fixed it must work on both machines.

*USE IPS
Apply the International Patch Standard on a file.
This type was invented by DAX and ME, we got a lot
of success with it, because we released the programs
on ATARI/AMIGA AND PC format at the same time.

Pick an IPS file first, the the game to be patched.
If IPS2 is detected, it will write a temporary file
called TEMP.SMC then renames it back to the original.
IPS2 files are ment to 'Cut' a file.
Kill them fucking advertisement Intro's...

*CREATE IPS
Compares 2 files, then write the difference to a file called
'2ndname.IPS'.

*ADD HEADER
Test the size, and if ok writes a TEMP.SMC, renaming it afterwoods.
Works on multiple files.

*REPAIR HEADER
Auto detects multiple files, ask for S-ram on/off, Hirom yes/no,
with wildcard selected, also for mode 24 (other place of S-ram).
then patches all files accordingly.

*REMOVE INTRO
Tries to find and restore the original reset vector then cut's off
the intro (if added to the end).
Does NOT work on the latest Anthrox intro's, the ones who modify
a lot of 'blanking instructions'.
Does NOT work with the 'Hidden reset vector' stuff.

*SEND & RUN
Pick a file to send, make sure you have selected the correct
configuration, else strange things might happen.
It will detect multiple files and send the rest also.
after loading 1 or 2 blocks a file info menu will pop up,
containing some useful information about the game.
Some company's could be wrong, because they use the incorrect company-
value. 
Esc cancels the sending.

*SLOWFIX ON/OFF
If ON each loaded block is scanned for fixes, if found it will
be patched in memory only, just before sending, at the end of
sending, the number of fixes will be displayed in the same box.

*FILEINFO
Go to browsing mode by using <TAB> press return on a snes file to get
your information, exit with <TAB> again or esc.  
	 
*EXIT
Press ESC in SELECTION mode to quit.

*CHOOSE DRIVE
press A or C to Z to choose another Harddisk or CD-Rom

*DELETE
In the file selector you can press the DELETE key to kill a file..

*FILESELECTOR CONTROL KEYS
Use the Cursor keys to Move Up and Down to select files
and Left and Right to go in and out of Directories.

*HOT-KEYS
 The HOT Keys are obvious since there Green and in Capitals.(Sledge & MCA)

4. Xchar version 2 - same description as as xchar v1 but
                     it allows you to edit other roms.(nes/gb/smc/smd)
5. Xchar version 2 - same as above.

6. CartDisk

  A)   What is it:

          Display the cartridge information (ROM/SRAM size, Title, Licensee, 
Country, Version, etc.) of the cartridge plugged into the interface.
Browse through cartridge information contained in image files on disk(s).
Copy the cartridge to disk (up to 32Mbits, including HiROM support).
Load a cartridge image from disk *
Compare a cartridge image with a cartridge in the interface.
Copy, load and clear the Static RAM on any cartridge **
Convert between image formats (SMC/SWC and Game Doctor)
Split an image in half.
Join two images together.

*Pad an image which is not an even number of Mbits.

*Destroy PAL/NTSC, SRAM protect and FastROM detect codes 
Use Game Genie, Gold Finger and Action Replay codes to cheat in games 

*Convert between Game Genie, Gold Finger and Action Replay codes.

*Apply an IPS patch on an image.

*Modify game information such as title, ROM/RAM size, Licensee, Country, etc. 


7) RipGRFX

   WHat is it:

     This nifty tool allows you to rip the grafix out of snes
games so you can do whatever u want with 'em. :)

  How do i use it:


    Ripgrfx <filename>.swc 
*must be in swc format!!

III. The process
----------------


A. The ROM

        First of all, you have to choose a rom to hack. This ROM can be
ines/pasofami/gameboy/snes/genesis format depending on the tool you use.
Xchar version 2 allows you to edit several formats ( I'm hoping that
they will improve the controls somewhat, but its a good tool )


B. Changing graphics

        Here's where the fun part comes in. Load up your ROM and go to
View --> Pattern tables. A window should pop up with funny looking graphics.
Start your game and find a certain sprite, such as Link in Zelda 2. Now, your
sprite and the palette in the pattern table are probably different, so right
click the left or right side of the table until the table palette and the
sprite palette are the same. Search through the table and find a part of your
sprite. Click on it. Another window should pop up. Under this window, you have
an enlarged tile of that part of your sprite. Click on a color and change the
sprite around. When your done editing your sprites, you can save your changes
by clicking on File --> Write VROM. Be sure to make a backup copy of the
original ROM before writing the VROM. (Blackfury)
       
      Using Xchar is self explanatory. you simply scroll down until you
find the character you wish to edit and press enter. This will bring up
a closer view of the sprite and also a color table (only 4). Then u edit as 
you wish and press " S " to save it. 

How do I use Xchar? Easy use these commands:

(1) Viewing mode:

 [~] Toggle SNES mode (NES mode by default)
 [space] Change bitdepth (SNES mode only)
 [\] Change byte offset (if tile appears disaligned, use this)
 [-] Shrink tile array x dimension by 1
 [+] Enlarge tile array x dimension by 1
 [[] Shrink tile array y dimension by 1
 []] Enlarge tile array y dimension by 1
 [pgup]  Move up one page
 [pgdn]  Move down one page
 [up]    Move up one line
 [down]  Move down one line
 [left]  Move up one character
 [right] Move down one character
 [enter] Open tile array editor
 [s] Save editted rom
 [l] Reload rom
 [x] cut tile array
 [c] copy tile array
 [v] paste tile array
 [esc]   Exit program

(2) Editing mode:

 [esc]   Return to view mode
 [+] Zoom in
 [-] Zoom out 

(3) Viewing mode:

 [mouse right]   grab tile
 [mouse left]    place tile/press button

(4) Editing:

 [mouse right]   grab color
 [mouse left]    place color/press button

         Another tool that comes in handy for grafix is Romhack.
(desciption above in section II )  this is  used to find the grafix u 
want to edit then you press a key and presto you see the bytes
in hex or ascii, which u can then edit with a hex editor. Rather nifty.
(HomePage at  http://www.ipsnet.it/netpages/room481)

C. Changing text

        Changing text is a little more complicated than changing graphics.
First you are going to need to make a text table. To do this, go to a part of
a game where there is text. Then, load up your pattern tables and find where
the letters are. In ZELDA 2, for instance, the number 0 is located at D0.
Other numbers/letters follow, so our chart will look like this:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
0 
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
A
B
C
D 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
E G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V
F W X Y Z     -

        Now, open up your hex editor and load the ROM. With given text from
the game, search for it. For example, ZELDA in Zelda 2 would be F3DEE5DDDA in
hex. If you do not understand any of this, then text editing is just not for
you. Now, search through the ROM for your numbers. When you find them, just
replace the old numbers with the new ones.

NOTE: Do NOT make your word longer than the first word. Shorter is all right,
if you replace the extra letters with spaces or something else. (Blackfury)

IV. The Nintendo :
    
(A) General Architecture :

  NES is based on the 6502 CPU, and a custom video controller known as PPU
(Picture Processing Unit). The PPU's video memory is separated from the
main CPU memory and can be read/written via special ports. Cartridges may
contain both ROM appearing in the main CPU address space at $8000-$FFFF,
and VROM or VRAM appearing in the PPU address space at $0000-$1FFF and
containing the Pattern Tables (aka Tile Tables). In smaller cartridges,
which only have 16kB ROM, it takes place at $C000-$FFFF leaving $8000-$BFFF
area unused. Internal NES VRAM is located at addresses $2000-$3FFF in the 
PPU memory. Some cartridges also have RAM at $6000-$7FFF, which may or may
not be battery-backed. 

CPU Memory Map
--------------------------------------- $10000
 Upper Bank of Cartridge ROM
--------------------------------------- $C000
 Lower Bank of Cartridge ROM
--------------------------------------- $8000
 Cartridge RAM (may be battery-backed)
--------------------------------------- $6000
 Expansion Modules
--------------------------------------- $5000
 Input/Output
--------------------------------------- $2000
 2kB Internal RAM, mirrored 4 times
--------------------------------------- $0000


(B) Interrupts :

  NES uses non-maskable interrupts (NMIs) generated by PPU in the end of
each frame (so-called VBlank interrupts). Maskable interrupts, or IRQs,
can also be generated by circuitry in a cart, but most carts do not
generate them. The VBlank interrupts can be enabled/disabled by writing
1/0 into 7th bit of $2000. When a VBlank interrupts occur, CPU pushes
return address and the status register on stack, and jumps to the address
stored at location $FFFA (ROM in NES). The interrupt handler is supposed
to finish its execution with RTI command which returns CPU to the main
program execution. More information on the interrupt handling can be found
in a decent book on 6502 CPU. 


(C) I/O ports :

   NES internal I/O ports are mapped into the areas of $2000-$2007 and 
$4000-$4017. Some ports' usage is unknown or unclear, and any information
is appreciated.

I/O Ports Map

(D) PPU Memory :

  In a real NES, reading/writing PPU memory should only be attempted
during VBlank period. Many smaller ROMs have read-only memory (VROM) for
the Pattern Tables. In this case, you won't be able to write into this
memory. The $3F00 and $3F10 locations in VRAM mirror each other (i.e. it
is the same memory cell) and define the background color of the picture. 

   Writing to PPU memory:
   a) Write upper address byte into $2006
   b) Write lower address byte into $2006
   c) Write data into $2007. After each write, the address will
      increment either by 1 (bit 2 of $2000 is 0) or by 32 (bit 2 of
      $2000 is 1).

   Reading from PPU memory:
   a) Write upper address byte into $2006
   b) Write lower address byte into $2006
   c) Read data from $2007. The first byte read from $2007 will be
      invalid. Then, the address will increment by 1 after each
      read.

  Name Table contains tile numbers organized into 32 rows of 32 bytes
each. Tiles are 8x8 pixels each. Therefore, the whole Name Table is 32x32
tiles or 256x256 pixels. In the NTSC version of NES, upper and lower 16
pixels are not shown, thus, the screen becomes 256x224 pixels. In the PAL
version of NES, upper and lower 8 pixels are not show, thus, the screen
becomes 256x240 pixels.

  Pattern Table contains tile images in the following format:

  Character   Colors      Contents of Pattern Table
  ...o....    00010000    00010000 $10  +-> 00000000 $00
  ..O.O...    00202000    00000000 $00  |   00101000 $28
  .0...0..    03000300    01000100 $44  |   01000100 $44
  O.....O.    20000020    00000000 $00  |   10000010 $82
  ooooooo. -> 11111110    11111110 $FE  |   00000000 $00
  O.....O.    20000020    00000000 $00  |   10000010 $82
  0.....0.    30000030    10000010 $82  |   10000010 $82
  ........    00000000    00000000 $00  |   00000000 $00
                              +---------+

  Note that only two bits for each pixel of a character are stored in the
Pattern Table. Other two are taken from the Attribute Table. Thus, the total
number of simultaneous colors on the NES screen is 16.

  Each byte in the Attribute Table represents a 4x4 group of tiles on the 
screen, which makes an 8x8 attribute table. Each 4x4 tile group is
subdivided into four 2x2 squares as follows:

   (0,0)  (1,0) 0|  (2,0)  (3,0) 1
   (0,1)  (1,1)  |  (2,1)  (3,1)
   --------------+----------------
   (0,2)  (1,2) 2|  (2,2)  (3,2) 3
   (0,3)  (1,3)  |  (2,3)  (3,3)

  The attribute byte contains upper two bits of the color number for each
2x2 square (the lower two bits are stored in the Pattern Table): 

  Bits   Function                        Tiles
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  7,6    Upper color bits for square 3   (2,2),(3,2),(2,3),(3,3)    
  5,4    Upper color bits for square 2   (0,2),(1,2),(0,3),(1,3)
  3,2    Upper color bits for square 1   (2,0),(3,0),(2,1),(3,1)
  1,0    Upper color bits for square 0   (0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)
   
  There are two 16-byte Palette Tables: the one at $3F00, used for the
picture, and another one at $3F10, containing the sprite palette. The
$3F00 and $3F10 locations in VRAM mirror each other (i.e. it is the same
memory cell) and define the background color of the picture. 

  There is only enough VRAM for 2 Name Tables and Attribute Tables. Two
others are going to be mirrors of the first two, i.e. exact copies of them.
Which pages are mirrored depends on the cartridge circuitry. With vertical
mirroring, tables 2 and 3 are the mirrors of pages 0 and 1 appropriately.
With horizontal mirroring, pages 1 and 3 are the mirrors of pages 0 and 2
appropriately.

(E) Hit/VBlank Bits 

   The VBlank flag is contained in the 7th bit of read-only location $2002. 
It indicates whether PPU is scanning the screen, or generating a vertical
blanking impulse. It is set in the end of each frame (scanline 232), and
stays on until the next screen refresh starts from the scanline 8. The
program can reset this bit prematurely by reading from $2002.

   The Hit flag is contained in the 6th bit of read-only location $2002. 
It goes to 1 when PPU starts refreshing the first scanline where sprite#0
is located. For example, if sprite#0's Y coordinate is 34, the Hit flag
will be set in scanline 34. The Hit flag is reset when vertical blanking
impulse starts. The program can reset this bit prematurely by reading from
$2002. 


(F) Joysticks :

  There are two joysticks which are accessed via locations $4016 and
$4017. To reset joysticks, write first 1, then 0 into $4016. This way, you
will generate a strobe in the joysticks' circuitry. Then, read either from
$4016 (for joystick 0) or from $4017 (for joystick 1).  Each read will
give you the status of a single button in the 0th bit (1 if pressed, 0
otherwise): 

Read # |    1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8
-------+---------------------------------------------------------
Button |    A      B   SELECT   START   UP    DOWN   LEFT  RIGHT

  Bit 1 indicates whether joystick is connected to the port or not. It is
set to 0 if the joystick is connected, 1 otherwise. Bits 6 and 7 of
$4016/$4017 also seem to have some significance, which is not clear yet.
The rest of bits is set to zeroes. Some games expect to get *exactly* $41
from $4016/$4017, if a button is pressed, which has to be taken into
account. 


(G) Sprites :

  There are 64 sprites, which can be either 8x8 or 8x16 pixels. Sprites
patterns are stored in one of the Pattern Tables in the PPU Memory. Sprite
attributes are stored in the Sprite Memory of 256 bytes, which is not a
part of neither CPU nor PPU address space. The entire contents of Sprite
Memory can be written via DMA transfer using location $4014 (see above).
Sprite Memory can also be accessed byte-by-byte by putting the starting
address into $2003 and then writing/reading $2004 (the address will be
incremented after each access). The format of sprite attributes is as
follows: 

Sprite Attribute RAM:
| Sprite#0 | Sprite#1 | ... | Sprite#62 | Sprite#63 |
     |          |
     +---- 4 bytes: 0: Y position of the left-top corner - 1
                    1: Sprite pattern number
                    2: Color and attributes:
                       bits 1,0: two upper bits of color
                       bits 2,3,4: Unknown (???)
                       bit 5: if 1, display sprite behind background
                       bit 6: if 1, flip sprite horizontally
                       bit 7: if 1, flip sprite vertically
                    3: X position of the left-top corner

Sprite patterns are fetched in the exactly same way as the tile patterns
for the background picture. The only difference occurs in the 16x8
sprites: the top half of the sprite is taken from the Sprite Pattern Table
set in the $2000 port, while the bottom part is taken from the same
location of the alternative Pattern Table. Therefore, if PPU is displaying
a 16x8 sprite, and the Sprite Pattern Table is set to $1000, the bottom
half of this sprite will be taken out of the $0000 Pattern Table, and vice
versa. 


(H) Memory Mappers :

  There are many diffirent memory mappers (aka MMCs) used in the NES 
cartridges. They are used to switch ROM and VROM pages, and do some other 
tasks. I will only describe the MMCs I'm familiar with. Any new 
information on these and other MMCs is highly appreciated. The MMC 
numbers are given in terms of the .NES file field "Mapper Type".


1.  Mapper #1, Sequential

  This is a sequential mapper used in many 256kB cartridges, such as
Bomberman 2, Destiny Of The Emperor, Megaman 2, Airwolf, Operation Wolf,
Castlevania 2, Silk Worm, Yoshi, Break Thru. It may be used to switch ROM
and VROM. If there is no VROM, 8kB of VRAM is present at $0000. In some
cases (mostly RPG games) such cartridges also contain battery-backed RAM
at $6000-$7FFF. The mapper has four 5bit registers, which are accessed via
following addresses: 

Register  Address Range  Function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0         $8000-$9FFF    Mirroring and VROM Page Size select
          The 0th bit of this register selects the mirroring type (1 for
          horizontal, 0 for vertical). The 4th bit selects the size of
          VROM pages. When it is 1, two 4kB VROM pages can be switched
          independently at $0000 and $1000. Otherwise, there is a single
          8kB VROM page at $0000.

1         $A000-$BFFF    VROM page select
          This register sets either 8kB or 4kB VROM page at $0000,
          depending on the page size selected via register 0.

2         $C000-$DFFF    Second VROM page select for 4kB pages
          If 4kB VROM pages selected via register 0, this register sets
          the VROM page at $1000. Otherwise, its value is ignored.

3         $E000-$FFFF    ROM page select
          This register sets 16kB ROM page at $8000. The page at $C000 is 
          always hardwired to the last ROM page in the cartridge. The 
          cartridge starts with page 0 at $8000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In order to write to a mapper register, write $80 into any of the
locations first. This will reset the mapper. Then write the value bit by
bit into an appropriate address range. For example, the following assembly
code will write $0C into register 3: 

     lda  #$80     ; Resetting mapper
     sta  $8000    ;
     lda  #$0C     ; This is our value
     sta  $EFD9    ; Writing bit 0
     lsr  a        ; Shifting
     sta  $EFD9    ; Writing bit 1
     lsr  a        ; Shifting
     sta  $EFD9    ; Writing bit 2
     lsr  a        ; Shifting
     sta  $EFD9    ; Writing bit 3
     lsr  a        ; Shifting
     sta  $EFD9    ; Writing bit 4


2. Mapper #2, Konami

  This is a quite simple mapper used in most Konami (Life Force,
Castlevania, Metal Gear) and some other cartridges. It only switches the
ROM. All cartridges with this mapper have 8kB VRAM at $0000 (i.e. no
VROM). The mapper has a single 8bit register which can be written via
locations $8000-$FFFF. It contains a number of 16kB ROM page at $8000. 
The page at $C000 is always hardwired to the last ROM page in the
cartridge. The cartridge starts with page 0 at $8000.

  There is one more thing to note about this mapper: although any address
in the $8000-$FFFF range can be used to access the mapper, most games
prefer to use the address with the last digit equal to the value they
write out. Thus, $07 can be written to $9FF7, $05 to $9FF5, and so forth.
The reason for this is unknown. 


3. Mapper #3, VROM Switch

  Mapper #3, also known as a VROM switch, is used in the Goonies series
and many Japanese-only games. It only allows you to switch 8kB pages of
VROM. The ROM is either 16kB or 32kB and is not paged. The mapper has a
single 8bit register which can be written via locations $8000-$FFFF. It
contains a number of 8kB VROM page at $0000. 

  As with mapper #2, many games use locations with the last digit equal to
the value being written. I do not know why. 


4. Mapper #4, 5202 Chip (???)

  This mapper (or should I say 'an expansion chip'?) is used in many
recent cartridges, such as Batman Returns, Super Contra, Vindicators,
Silver Surfer, etc. It is an extremely complicated device, which is able
to generate its own interrupts via IRQ line, and has a set of commands to
switch ROM and VROM. VROM pages are 1kB, ROM pages appear to be 8kB. I do
not completely understand how this mapper works, so any information is
appreciated. 

  The chip is controlled via following locations:

Address  Function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
$8000    A command number (0-7) is written here. Also, write to this 
         register appears to reset the change made by a write into $E000.
$8001    An value for command is written here.
$A000    The 0th bit controls mirroring (1 = horizontal mirroring).
$A001    Same as $8001 (???)
$C000    Unknown
$C001    Unknown
$E000    The 5th bit appears to swap memory at $8000-$8FFF and 
         $A000-$AFFF, when set to 1.
$E001    Unknown
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In order to use the mapper, you should first write a command number 
into $8000, and then a value (page number) into $8001. Following commands 
exist:

Cmd  Function
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0   Select 2 consequent 1kB VROM pages at $0000. The 0th bit of a value
     written into $8001 does not matter, i.e. 5 will always select pages
     4 and 5.
 1   Select 2 consequent 1kB VROM pages at $0800. The 0th bit of a value
     written into $8001 does not matter, i.e. 5 will always select pages
     4 and 5.
 2   Select a 1kB VROM page at $1000.
 3   Select a 1kB VROM page at $1400.
 4   Select a 1kB VROM page at $1800.
 5   Select a 1kB VROM page at $1C00.
 6   Select a 8kB ROM page at $8000. The initial value seems to be 0.
 7   Select a 8kB ROM page at $A000. The initial value seems to be 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note that the ROM pages at $C000 and $E000 are hardwired to the last 
pages of the ROM, and can not be switched (they can be swapped via 
$E000 though).


5. Other mappers

  There are several other mappers, some of them very sophisticated. iNES
partially supports them, but as this support either doesn't work
correctly, or the mappers are uncommon (such as 100-in-1 cartridge mapper,
I don't cover them here. (Marat Fayzullin)

 V. Sample walkthrough

        We're going to change Zelda 2 around a little bit. Load it up and
start where the princess is sleeping. Go to View --> Pattern tables. In the
tables, click on the left side of the table 3 times, or until the tiles are
brown, tan, green, and black. Click on the upper left tile; this is Link's
face. Click on the black color then click on where Link's eyes are. Black
signifies that it is see through, so now you can see the background through
Link's head. Now save it by clicking on File --> Write VROM. Now go to the
first town. Talk to somebody. Now open your pattern tables again and locate
the letters. In this case, 0 is D0, and so on as stated in the above table.
Now load up a hex editor. Use the table to find a complete word (or two), with
F4's being spaces in Zelda 2. Search for at least 7 letters in a word so you
now you are editing the right thing. Replace those numbers with, say, F1, or
'X'. Save the ROM. Back in NESticle, load up your new ROM. Go back to that
same person, and talk to him/her. Does his speech seem a little different?
