What is the cartridge pin layout?

If the SNES doesn't detect the CIC while power is on, then it will not
continue to read the cartridge. Further details of this are not known to
me.

LoROM:    32kbyte pages/banks (A15 not used - assumed high)

HiROM:    64kbyte pages/banks

BA0-BA7 switch between a possible 256 banks/pages.

LoROM data is stored in the upper 32kbytes of the possible 64kbyte
bank/page (A15 is assumed high). Using 64kbyte pages, the SNES can address
a huge 16Mbytes or 128Mbits!

According to a SNES memory map, LoROM games can be as large as 16Mbit while
HiROM games are limited to 32Mbit... what about the 48Mbit game floating
around?

What is the ROM pin layout?

This pin layout was taken from a Donkey Kong Country 2 cartridge and seems
to be consistent with all their mask ROMs (some are 32pin, others 36pin).

What is the DSP1 pin layout?

This was taken from a hacked Pilotwings cartridge with a switch on it -
possibly to select between HiROM and LoROM DSP1 games. I'm not 100% sure
that the following is correct or complete though.

                D8   14   15   CLOCK?

If you can verify/correct this, it would be greatly appreciated.

What is the MAD-1 and its pin layout?

The MAD-1 stands for Memory Address Decoder revision 1. It is used on the
Donkey Kong Country (1 and 2) cartridge and possibly other cartridges in
order to address one or two ROMs and a static RAM.

               /HI   01   16   /LO

               /SE   02   15   A13

                     03   14   A14

               Vcc   05   12   A15

               Vcc   06   11   /CS (p49 SNES slot)

               Vcc   07   10   Vcc

               GND   08   09   RESET (p26 SNES slot)

/RE - /CS on a 32Mbit ROM (possibly for MAD-1a only)

/LO - /CS on ROM1 (lower 16mbit)

/HI - /CS on ROM2 (upper 16mbit)

/SE - /CS on Static RAM

What is the pin layout of the 16kbit SRAM most commonly used by Nintendo?

It seems that Nintendo uses this SRAM in many of their games, mainly
because it is very cheap, only $A5 (retail) - much cheaper for Nintendo who
buys millions of them. It can address up to 2048 bytes or 16kbits.

                A7   01   24   Vcc

                A6   02   23   A8

               Vss   12   13   D3

                        Cartridge Addressing Schemes

    LoROM cartridges:                HiROM cartridges:

               A15, BA4, BA5 high               A13, A14, BA5 high

Would anyone like to verify this?

At the time of writing, the largest SNES game is 48Mbit, while 8Mbit
cartridges are the most common. There are cartridge sizes of 10Mbit,
12Mbit, 20Mbit and 24Mbit, which are reported as 16Mbit, 16Mbit, 16Mbit and
32Mbit respectively.

Another way of calculating the ROM size is: 1 shl (ROMbyte-7) MegaBits

Game Version (1 byte)

The version is stored as version 1.VersionByte and must be less than 128.
i.e. Less than 1.128.

Inverse ROM Checksum (2 bytes)

This is the same as XORing the two checksum bytes. i.e. The checksum bits
are inversed.

ROM Checksum (2 bytes)

The checksum is a 16bit word with the lower 8bits stored first, followed by
the upper 8bits.

The checksum is calculated by dividing the ROM into 4Mbit chunks then
adding all the bytes in these chunks together. Once you have the checksum
for each chunk, add them together and take the lower 32bits of the result.

With a non-standard image size, you do not get it equally divisible by
4Mbit (excluding 2Mbit images). e.g. 10Mbit = 4Mbit + 4Mbit + 2Mbit chunks.

Therefore, you must create a 4Mbit chunk from what is left over. Using the
same example, you would add the checksum of the following chunks to get the
ROM checksum:

                      4Mbit + 4Mbit + (2Mbit + 2Mbit)
                                     or
                        4Mbit + 4Mbit + (2 x 2Mbit)

Non Maskable Interrupt / VBL Vector (2 bytes)

LoROM: at offset 33274

HiROM: at offset 66042

Reset Vector (2 bytes)

Where to start the ROM code.

LoROM: at offset 33276

HiROM: at offset 66042 [correction by Qwertie: 66044?]

How do I know if the ROM is HiROM or LoROM?

When you OR the checksum bytes of a disk image and the inverse checksum
bytes, the result should be FFFF hex. Therefore, to detect whether an image
is HiROM or LoROM, you must read those bytes, OR them, and see if they
equal FFFF hex.

The ROM's type depends at which location the OR'd bytes equal FFFF hex. If
it isn't found at either location, then the other way of checking is to see
at which location the title contains uppercase alphanumeric characters.
(But this fails with most Japanese cartridges)

Why don't you use the ROM Makeup Byte? You can, and some utilities do, but
some utilities allow you to change this byte, so incorrect results may
occur.

For the actual ROM, the embedded cartridge information is stored at the
same position for both LoROM and HiROM. In this case, you must use the ROM
Makeup Byte or read a 64kb page and see if both 32kb chunks (upper and
lower 32kb) are the same. If they are the same, it is LoROM (32kb pages -
A15 is not used, the data repeats itself) otherwise it is HiROM.

As a general rule of thumb, if you can't detect which ROM type it is,
default to LoROM, as these are the most common of cartridges.

                           Cheat Device Decoding

We'll start with the easiest first then work our way down. These codes work
by replacing a byte at a specific location in the ROM.

E.g. In the game F-Zero, at a particular position in the ROM, there is a
number 3 indicating 3 lives to start off with. What a cheat code will do is
replace this byte with, let's say, the number 9, so now when the game is
run, the player starts off with 9 lives.

Pro Action Replay (hardware)

Code format:        AAAAAADD            (8 digits)

A - Address

D - Data

These codes are in Hex, the address being a CPU address, not a direct ROM
location (more about this later).

Gold Finger (software)

Code format:        AAAAADDDDDDCCW      (14 digits)

A - Address

D - Data

C - Checksum

W - What to change (DRAM or SRAM)

This code was designed for the copiers, and are straight Hex characters.
Therefore the Address is a ROM address, not a CPU address. Data bytes are
arranged in 2 characters (2 D's per byte), which allows for 3 bytes. If a
byte is not being used, it is denoted by 'XX'. I have never seen a code
with three unused bytes - what's the point of one anyhow?

The address (A's) is a base address. The first data byte (D's) is to be
placed at this address. The second at address+1, the third at address+2 (if
to be used, that is, if they are not 'XX').

To calculate the checksum you must take the A's and D's, add a zero (0) to
the front of the shortened code, then divide into block's of 2 hex digits
(bytes). Add these hex digits together (2 characters per hex digit) then
minus 160 hex (352 decimal). Now AND this number by FF hex (255 decimal) to
get the lower 8 bits (byte). Convert this number to hex and you have your
checksum (C's).

W tells the copier whether to replace the byte in the DRAM (ROM image) or
the SRAM (Saved game static RAM) of the copier.

Value of W  Where to place byte

    0       DRAM (ROM image)

    1       SRAM (Saved game image)

The rec.games.video FAQ specifies that there may be non- standard values of
2, 8, A, C, F for W, which may be converted to 0. I personally have only
seen Gold Finger codes with W = 0.

Game Genie (hardware)

Code format:        DDAA-AAAA      (8 digits)

A - Address

D - Data

This is the most difficult code to decipher out of the lot. It is as
follows:

First take the code in the form xxxx-xxxx and take out the dash ('-') to
form xxxxxxxx. Convert these characters (Genie Hex) to normal hex
characters using the following table:

Genie Hex:    D  F  4  7  0  9  1  5  6  B  C  8  A  2  3  E

Normal  Hex:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F

The first two characters is the data byte in Hex. Now take the other 6
following characters (encoded address) and put it into it's binary form of
24 bits.

Now take each bit of the encoded address and rearrange to form the real
address:

24bit encoded address: ijklqrst opabcduv wxefghmn

8bit encoded data:     ABCDEFGH

Rearrange as:

24bit address             : 8bit data

abcdefgh ijklmnop qrstuvwx: ABCDEFGH

MSB                    LSB  MSB  LSB

Bit 23 of the encoded address (bit 15 of the real address) is always 1. The
reason being that the SNES CPU address must be 1 for it to access the ROM.

Converting between CPU addresses and ROM addresses

This is very easy once you understand how it is done. To convert from a CPU
address to a ROM address, all you need to do is remove bit 15. By doing
this, I don't mean just setting it to 0. I mean by removing it, then moving
all bits after it down one.

e.g. ROMaddress = (CPUaddress and 7FFFh) or ((CPUaddress and FF0000h) shl 1)

Therefore, to convert from a ROM address to a CPU address, you must insert
a high bit into position 15 (bit 15).

e.g. CPUaddress = (ROMaddress and 7FFFh) or ((ROMaddress and 7F8000h) shr 1) or 8000h

Easily converting between codes

I have made available two DOS programs with source code on my WWW pages
which allow you to convert between Game Genie and Gold Finger codes. These
are available freely from http://www.parodius.com/~diskdude/CartDisk/.

Note: Because the Gold Finger can only address upto 8Mbit of game data,
while other codes can address upto 64Mbit of game data, some Game Genie and
Action Replay codes may not be converted to Gold Finger.

                                SNES Copiers

What are copiers?

A copier is a device which sits on top of the SNES and allows you to backup
your cartridges as well as play your backed up games. It does this by
storing the ROM image of a cartridge to floppy disks via a 1.44Mb disk
drive. Most copiers also include a parallel PC port interface, allowing
your PC to control the unit and store images on your hard drive.

Copier's contain DRAM from 1 Megabyte to 16 Megabytes, 8MegaBits to
128MegaBits respectively. This is the reason why they are so expensive.

It is legal to own and use a copier for your own personal backup of
cartridges which you legally own in this point in time, although it is
illegal to distribute this copy (only one copy is allowed). This may vary
depending on where you live.

If you wish to make your own "home brew" copier for the SNES, and other
consoles, more information can be found at
http://www.parodius.com/~diskdude/CartDisk/.

Super Wild Card (SWC) header information

The SWC (Super Wild Card) image format consists of a 512 byte header. It's
layout is as follows (set unused bytes to 00h):

Offset Function

  0    Lower 8 bits of size word

  1    Upper 8 bits of size word

  2    Image information byte

  8    SWC header identifier (set to AAh)

  9    SWC header identifier (set to BBh)

 10    SWC header identifier (set to 04h)

The size word is calculated by multiplying the image size, not game size
(in MegaBits) by 16. e.g. Image is 4 Mbits, so size word would be 4*16=64.

Image information byte (in the form of 76543210):

Bit  Description

7    1 - Run program in Mode 0 (JMP $8000)

     0 - Run program in Mode 1 (JMP RESET Vector)

6    1 - Multi image (there is another split file to follow)

     0 - Not multi image (no more split files to follow)

5    1 - SRAM memory mapping Mode 21 (HiROM)

     0 - SRAM memory mapping Mode 20

4    1 - DRAM memory mapping Mode 21 (HiROM)

     0 - DRAM memory mapping Mode 20

3/2  00: 256kbit SRAM

     01: 65kbit SRAM

     10: 16kbit SRAM

     11: no SRAM

1/0  reserved

Pro Fighter (FIG) header format

This format is similar to the SWC. It consists of a 512byte header who's
layout is as follows (set unused bytes to 00h):

Offset Function

  0    Lower 8 bits of size word

  1    Upper 8 bits of size word

  2    40h - Multi image

       00h - Last image in set (or single image)

  3    80h - if HiROM

       00h - if LoROM

  4    If using DSP1 microchip:

           FDh - If using SRAM (SRAM size>0)

           47h - If no SRAM (SRAM size=0)

       77h - If not using DSP1 and no SRAM (SRAM size=0)

  5    If using DSP1 microchip:

           82h - If using SRAM (SRAM size>0)

           83h - If no SRAM (SRAM size=0)

       83h - If not using DSP1 and no SRAM (SRAM size=0)

Game Doctor file name format

The Game Doctor does not use a 512 byte header like the SWC, instead it
uses specially designed filenames to distinguish between multi files. I'm
not sure if it used the filename for information about the size of the
image though.

Usually, the filename is in the format of: SFXXYYYZ.078

Where SF means Super Famicon, XX refers to the size of the image in Mbit.
If the size is only one character (i.e. 2, 4 or 8 Mbit) then no leading "0"
is inserted.

YYY refers to a catalogue number in Hong Kong shops identifying the game
title. (0 is Super Mario World, 1 is F- Zero, etc). I was told that the
Game Doctor copier produces a random number when backing up games.

Z indicates a multi file. Like XX, if it isn't used it's ignored.

A would indicate the first file, B the second, etc. I am told 078 is not
needed, but is placed on the end of the filename by systems in Asia.

e.g. The first 16Mbit file of Donkey Kong Country (assuming it is cat. no.
475) would look like: SF16475A.078

Super Wild Card parallel port I/O protocol

I was given this information a while ago. It is supposed to be direct from
the company which makes SWC's and I have included this information because
a few people have been asking for it. If you have similar information for
other backup devices, it would be appreciated if you could send it to me.

                           ROM Protection Schemes

This section details ways of bypassing the FastROM, PAL/NTSC and SRAM size
checks implemented in many SNES games in order to stop people backing them
up using copiers.

Note: You don't necessarily have to find and replace all strings to remove
the check(s).

SlowROM checks

Most cartridges these days use 120ns ROM in order to get the most out of
the ageing SNES. However, there are still many copiers around which emulate
ROM at speeds of 200ns meaning they cannot backup the newer cartridges
correctly.

Changing the ROM code to bypass the SlowROM check, found in many, but not
all FastROM games, allows many people with SlowROM copiers to backup
FastROM games.

To patch a ROM and bypass the SlowROM check, you must find any of the
following strings in the image and replace it with the patch string: (all
codes in hex)

Search for          Replace with

A9 01 8D 0D 42      A9 00 8D 0D 42

A9 01 8E 0D 42      A9 00 8E 0D 42

A2 01 8D 0D 42      A2 00 8D 0D 42

A9 01 8F 0D 42 00   A9 00 8F 0D 42 00

PAL/NTSC checks

Most SNES games have code which detects which video system the cartridge is
being played on and refuses to run if not in the right mode. This is to
stop people from buying games from other countries before they are released
locally.

To bypass the PAL/NTSC check the following patterns must be found and
replaced with the ones specified: (all codes in hex)

SRAM size checks

Some SNES games check to see how much SRAM is connected to the SNES as a
form of copy protection. As most copiers have 256kbits standard, the game
will know it's running on a backup unit and stop to prevent people copying
the games. However, the newer copiers get around this detection somehow.

To disable the SRAM size check in a ROM image, search for the following and
replace as appropriate.

Note: All codes are in hex, although 'xx' means anything, while a comma
means search for either of the two or more (enclosed in brackets).

Search for     (8F, 9F) xx xx 70 (CF, DF) xx xx 70 D0

Replace with   (8F, 9F) xx xx 70 (CF, DF) xx xx 70 EA EA (if SRAM size of game = 64kbit)

                              IPS Patch Format

This patch format is used a lot for patching SNES ROM images. Therefore I
have included it's format in this text. For a more detailed explanation of
the IPS format, please visit the Damaged Cybernetics WWW pages
http://www.futureone.com/~damaged/.

The format is as follows:

   Description                    Size

IPS file identifier            5 bytes (characters PATCH)

Offset in file to place patch  3 bytes

Number of bytes in patch       2 bytes (allows 65535 patch bytes)

Patch byte(s)                  (specified by 'No. of bytes in patch')

        .                              .

        .                              .

Start again, looking           3 bytes (characters EOF)

for new offset, unless

and EOF is found.

Sample IPS file contents with 2 offset points:

PATCHooonn?ooonn?EOF

o - Offset in file

n - Number of bytes in patch

? - Data byte(s) (n number of bytes)
